Tom Lehrer said "I feel that if a person can't communicate the very least he can do is to shut up". Which is fair enough. But he could also try to improve. Here's my contribution to helping him do that.





Like a magpie, I collect shiny objects. Some are Krugerrands, others worthless tinfoil, and like a magpie, I often find it difficult to tell them apart. Sometimes, too, the worthless becomes valuable and the valuable worthless. It all depends. Here, then, is sampling from my collections of baubles, with bits of explanation.




**Parody** can be very powerful at opening our eyes to what is already there, hidden often in plain sight. One that attracted a lot of attention in late 2010 was Martin Robbins' delicious [This is a news website article about a scientific finding](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1) in The Guardian. I wonder, though, what you make of this piece in response? [(Don’t) Keep it Simple](http://www.scienceprogress.org/2010/11/don%E2%80%99t-keep-it-simple/) appeared on a website that might repay closer investigation. And the reporting of science in the mainstream media has long been a [source of anxiety](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005074.html).




Robbins' article resonated with many writers and a few readers precisely because it was so very accurate, but it was by no means the first such meta-effort. Charlie Brooker, an English comedian, did exactly the same thing for local TV news-reporting in [this video: How to Report the News](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHun58mz3vI). That may be a softer target, but it also requires viewers to share the same cultural frame of reference to find it funny. A bit like [Ronnie Corbett's "blackberry" sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAG39jKi0lI). Would you ever have imagined, 20 years ago, that ordinary people would have laughed at that? I wouldn't.





Once you start looking, parodies and meta-articles are everywhere. On the occasion of the G8 Gideon Rachman at the Financial Times recycled wonderful advice on [How to write about pointless international organisations](http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2008/07/the-g8-and-alan-beattie/#more-337), and that echoed an earlier article that told people [How to Write about Africa](http://www.granta.com/Magazine/92/How-to-Write-about-Africa/Page-1). Almost more interesting is Binyavanga Wainaina's account of [how he came to write the piece](http://www.bidoun.org/magazine/21-bazaar-ii/how-to-write-about-africa-ii-the-revenge-by-binyavanga-wainaina/). William Easterley took up a similar theme in [How to write about poor people](http://aidwatchers.com/2009/12/how-to-write-about-poor-people/).





Some of the very best parodies are so simple they just make me weep tears of joy and envy. Like [this one](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/laugh-if-you-must-but-it-is-published-in-a-refereed-journal.html).





**Guides and How-tos** can be helpful, although there is no substitute for practice: write, read, reflect, revise. Repeat. And not just for your own writing. I am a huge fan of John McPhee, and everything I've read of his has taught me about two distinct things. One is the subject he chooses to write about. The other is how he chooses to write about it. That's often harder to learn, because you have to do the sleuthing yourself. So an interview in [The Paris Review](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5997/the-art-of-nonfiction-no-3-john-mcphee), in which he talks about his techniques is a double joy. Here's what he says about making use of the material you've got:




> I always say to my classes that it’s analogous to cooking a dinner. You go to the store and you buy a lot of things. You bring them home and you put them on the kitchen counter, and that’s what you’re going to make your dinner out of. If you’ve got a red pepper over here—it’s not a tomato. You’ve got to deal with what you’ve got. You don’t have an ideal collection of material every time out.



Tim Radford, whom I have the honour to call a friend, shared a few of his rules in his [25 commandments for journalists](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/jan/19/manifesto-simple-scribe-commandments-journalists). And from the other side of the fence, a climate scientist, Simon L. Lewis offers advice on [How to beat the media in the climate street fight](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101103/full/468007a.html?s=news_rss). There are lists and guides for all manner of topics. [Ten ingredients help take up development research](http://euforic.blogspot.com/2008/07/ten-ingredients-help-take-up.html) could use a little help writing its headlines, but no matter. Grant-givers, such as the UK [Department for International Development](http://www.dfid.gov.uk/research/communication-research.pdf) are starting to advise grantees on what and how to communicate, and this is going to become more common.





There's no end of advice on [How to write scientific papers](http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/10/21/how-to-write-scientific-papers/), [^fn1]
[^fn1]: Neatly locked away behind a paywall, so that fewer people can benefit.)) much less on [How to write consistently boring scientific literature](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15674.x/full). And it isn't just a matter of ignoring the rules, or deliberately breaking them. That's partly because different kinds of writing follow different kinds of rules. [Writing Style for Print vs. Web](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/print-vs-online-content.html) explores some of the more obvious pitfalls of writing for the internet. (And for the many articles that don't (thank heavens) follow Jacob Neilsen's strictures, because they're pubished on the web, not written for the web, you must know about [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com 

.





You'll note that there's nothing in this list that aspires to tell you in detail _How to write well_. That's because most of those guides are laughable in their inconsistency. Well, I get lot of laughs reading real linguists skewer those who would dispense advice about language. The biggest elephant trap of them all is the passive voice. Most people who tell you not to use it -- even the [august and very respectable BBC](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2990) -- have no idea what it actually is. [Here is the truth](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2922).





Writing is, of course, only one way of communicationg. There is also the presentation. Again, there's no shortage of advice on how to give a good presentation [for academics](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/speaking.html) and for [Galactic Civil War Rebel Generals.](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2010/08/a-long-time-ago-before-death-by-powerpoint.html) There's no difference, really, in the essentials of good presentations, and good presentations need [good images. Find them here.](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/01/where_can_you_f.html)





**What should you write about?** If you are tempted to write as yourself, rather than as a representative of your organization, then the most important thing you can do is contribute your expertise and make it available. Write what you know about. Especially where it can add to ideas that are in the public eye. In the debate about the US deficit, for example, one graduate student blogged about the [relative size of bits of the budget](http://www.jamesandthegiantcorn.com/2011/01/02/research-funding-is-a-drop-in-the-bucket/) originally published on a [comic site](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1305). Did that change anyone's behaviour? I don't know. Does that matter? No.



I depend on this kind of writing to help me in my own communications. I'm no expert on agricultural economics, for example, but I do need to know what to say about food price spikes. What causes them? [Evil speculators?](http://greedgreengrains.blogspot.com/2011/01/commodity-prices-and-speculation-again.html) Does it matter? Yes, but maybe [not in the obvious ways](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2011/02/rising-global-food-prices-why-you.html). What can be done? [More free trade](http://greedgreengrains.blogspot.com/2011/02/coping-with-high-and-volatile-food.html)? End agricultural subsidies, [or fix them](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/dont-end-agricultural-subsidies-fix-them/)? Note: I'm not saying which of these points of view I prefer or believe, just that I have better understanding of the subject because they are easily available. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: And note how many of the links I'm sharing here are to people who are likewise sharing. 







I could go on and on, but I must stop, which I will do by injecting a note of deadly cynicism. Two, actually. Both about changing behaviour. Or at least attitudes.





> It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it! [_Upton Sinclair_](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair).





> ...reasoning will never make a man correct an ill opinion, which by reasoning he never acquired... [^fn1]
[^fn1]: Often cited as "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into." But that is [currently unsourced](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Jonathan_Swift).
