Somewhere to mention the things I do outside [the work I'm paid to do](www.greenink.co.uk).

Here goes:

* I'm proud of what Luigi and I have done at [The Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog](http://agro.biodiver.se/) speaking truth to power and generally snarking it up.

* [Nothing New Under the Sun](/work/nothing-new-under-the-sun-introduction/) is a diatribe I penned ages ago. I still stand by everything in it, and more.

* The Sunday Times asked me to [review Oliver Morton's book Eating the Sun](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/science/article3017106.ece). A fine book that made it easy to review. Better yet, Oliver has a blog for each of his books, where he collects reviews and responds to them. [Thoughtfully](http://heliophage.wordpress.com/2007/12/10/review-jeremy-cherfas-in-the-sunday-times/). That's a neat idea. As for not writing enough about agriculture, I too would recommend Colin Tudge's So Shall We Reap, although [Feeding People Is Easy](http://paripublishing.com/books/feedingpeopleiseasy/)  is even more fun and provocative.

* Lots more at Thomson Reuters.
