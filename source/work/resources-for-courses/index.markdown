## Preliminary thoughts


[Upton Sinclair](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair) said:  



> It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!


And long before him, [Jonathan Swift](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift) reasoned that:  



> It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.



But hey, you might as well try. Maybe some of this will help.


## How to do it


Good examples are always worth reading and can be a very good teacher, if you let them. I have loads more …



	
  * [ On Being the Right Size](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/12/on-being-the-right-size/) A classic essay from the days when (some) scientists could write well, this has long been one of my absolute favourites. Great to see it republished at Farnam Street.

	
  * [Paris Review - The Art of Nonfiction No. 3, John McPhee](http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5997/the-art-of-nonfiction-no-3-john-mcphee) McPhee is absolutely one of my favourite writers, and this interview gives great insights into how he does what he does. Not that that makes it any easier.




> “I always say to my classes that it’s analogous to cooking a dinner. You go to the store and you buy a lot of things. You bring them home and you put them on the kitchen counter, and that’s what you’re going to make your dinner out of. If you’ve got a red pepper over here—it’s not a tomato. You’ve got to deal with what you’ve got. You don’t have an ideal collection of material every time out.”








## How to do it: Nuts and Bolts.





	
  * [The Reader’s Lament](http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/the-readers-lament/). Proof-reading really, really matters, but nobody gets it all right all the time. Not even _The New York Times_. Good advice, not all of which anyone can follow every time.

	
  * [Giving an Academic Talk](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ejrs/speaking.html). And not just for academics. Again, there are scores of these around the place. I like this one.

	
  * [Where can you find good images?](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2006/01/where_can_you_f.html) If you are giving a talk, you should think about different kinds of images, and how to use them. As above, here is just one good place to start, from an absolute expert.

	
  * [ How to interest aid agencies and policymakers in research](http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220167/index.en.shtml). A donor perspective on the differences between what researchers produce and what policy-makers and on-the-ground people need.

	
  * [Ten ingredients help take up development research](http://euforic.blogspot.com/2008/07/ten-ingredients-help-take-up.html). More of the same, from a different point of view.

	
  * [DFID’s notes on communication for the people they fund](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/%2B/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/research/communication-research.pdf). A PDF.

	
  * [Successful Science Communication](http://www.cambridge.org/es/knowledge/isbn/item6453536/). A New Book from Cambridge University Press has chapters from “successful practitioners”. I haven’t read it, but it could be interesting and useful.

	
  * [Simon Blackburn Reviews Stanley Fish’s “How To Write A Sentence”](http://www.tnr.com/book/review/stanley-fish-write-sentence). If the review does not send you to the book, that’s OK, but do read the review to see why sentences matter.

	
  * [A manifesto for the simple scribe – my 25 commandments for journalists](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/jan/19/manifesto-simple-scribe-commandments-journalists). Tim Radford happens to be a friend, but even if he weren’t I would still recommend this list.

	
  * [Writing Style for Print vs. Web](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/print-vs-online-content.html). Jakob Nielsen has very strong opinions, and the data to back them up, but I’m not sure I agree with everything he says. There’s a difference between writing _for_ the web and writing that happens to be _on_ the web.

	
  * [How to write 1000 words](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2010/video-how-to-write-1000-words/). Scott Berkun provides a commentary and advice while you watch a timelapse video of him writing the 1000 words.




## Why blog?


To share your insights, knowledge, experience and opinions, particularly on subjects that most of the rest of the world is wrong about. For example, on commodity prices and on government spending policies.

## And how to blog

## Scientists _versus_ journalists _versus_ scientists





	
  * [How should researchers talk about science to the public?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/20/making-science-accessible) Anne Osterrieder talks about making her research accessible.

	
  * [Standing up for Science, part 1](http://www.personalgenomics.us/1863/standing-up-for-science-part-1/) and [Standing up for Science, part 2](http://www.personalgenomics.us/1881/standing-up-for-science-part-2/). A genome scientist reflects on two media awareness workshops she went to.

  * [On Naïveté Among Scientists Who Wish to Communicate](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/evo-eco-lab/2011/10/04/on-naivete-among-scientists-who-wish-to-communicate/). Why it remains worth talking to mainstream media, and how to do it well.

Not to quibble with Fiona Fox, but the first claims of a human clone being born go back a lot further than 9 years …

  * [Scientists vs. Journalists: A Field Guide](http://deepseanews.com/2011/10/scientists-journalists-a-field-guide/). Cute, as far as it goes. Which is almost far enough. Also links to some other pieces exploring some of the same issues, and especially fact-checking.




## Parodic


The thing about parodies is that you have to understand the form really, really well to poke accurate fun at it, and that gives insights into the form itself. Parodies are a good condiment for the meat of nuts and bolts.



	
  * [A long time ago, before death by PowerPoint](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2010/08/a-long-time-ago-before-death-by-powerpoint.html). Presentation Zen wonders what might have happened if Star Wars generals had used standard PowerPoint templates.

	
  * [Laugh If You Must, But It Is Published in a Refereed Journal](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/laugh-if-you-must-but-it-is-published-in-a-refereed-journal.html). Pushing the limits of scientific publishing.

	
  * [Fighting the Scourge of Boring Writing](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/degrees-of-freedom/2011/08/30/the-lede-desk-fighting-the-scourge-of-boring-writing/). From a veteran newsman, how not to.

	
  * [This is a news website article about a scientific finding](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/24/1). Martin Robbins dissects the clichés. Absolutely sublime, although he doesn’t give credit to the piece I _think_ gave rise to this genre, the even more sublime

	
  * [How to Report the News](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHun58mz3vI) – a video by Charlie Brooker, on YouTube. Which in turn can be linked to a whole slew of similar pieces.

	
  * [How to write about pointless international organisations](http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2008/07/the-g8-and-alan-beattie/#more-337). Gideon Rachman of the FT reposts a colleague’s all-purpose column.

  * [How to write about poor people](http://aidwatchers.com/2009/12/how-to-write-about-poor-people/). William Easterly, also a little bitter.

	
  * And the granddaddy of them all, Binyavanga Wainaina’s How to write about Africa [Part 1](http://www.granta.com/Archive/92/How-to-Write-about-Africa/Page-1) and [Part 2](http://www.bidoun.org/magazine/21-bazaar-ii/how-to-write-about-africa-ii-the-revenge-by-binyavanga-wainaina/).



This thing is ongoing. I would love to receive your suggestions.
