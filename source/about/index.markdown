 My name is Jeremy Cherfas, and this is my About page. I am a biologist by training and a communicator by preference. That sounds pretentious. What I mean is that I write, and make radio programmes, and used to make TV programmes too. Lately I've started taking photos again, and putting together little mini-movies.

I live and work in Rome. (And I used to live and work in [Somerset](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.236853,-2.837176&spn=0.024045,0.053082&t=k&hl=en), the most beautiful county in England; I miss it.) This blog is a private endeavour. Beyond that, I'm not really sure what it is for. To give me an outlet. To enable me to share certain finds and ideas. As a safety valve. That'll do for now. You can always search for more.

You can [e-mail me](mailto:jcherfas%20at%20mac%20dot%20com) but you'll have to do a little editing of the address.

And then there's this:
