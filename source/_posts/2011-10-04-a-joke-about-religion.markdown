I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off.

So I ran over and said, "Stop! Don't do it!"

"Why shouldn't I?"

"Well, there's so much to live for!"

"Like what?"

"Well, are you religious or atheist?"

"Religious."

"Me too! What are you? Christian, Jewish, Buddhist? What?"

"Christian."

"Me too! Catholic or Protestant?"

"Protestant."

"Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?" 

"Baptist!"

"Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist Church of God or Baptist Church of the Lord?" 

"Baptist Church of God!"

"Me too! Original Baptist Church of God or Reformed Baptist Church of God?"

"Reformed Baptist Church of God!"

"No way! Me too! Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915?"

"Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915!"

I said, "Die, heretic scum!" and pushed him off.
