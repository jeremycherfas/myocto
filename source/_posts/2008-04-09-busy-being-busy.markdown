_This post is number 30 in [a series](http://jeremycherfas.net/category/50-x-100-x-50/)._

Racing around a bit at the moment, I pause to reflect that there is something energizing about simply having to much to do. I've gained an hour through the wonders of travel, and thus will manage to get this post in before the midnight deadline, and managed to accomplish a bunch of other stuff as well. Of course, most of that falls into the "best left unblogged" category. But how tawdry would it have been to have blogged about the mouthy woman on the crowded bus, who needed to share her entire content-free conversation with us all? Tomorrow.
