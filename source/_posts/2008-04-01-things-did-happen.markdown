![143502451 79B3Df8F82 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/143502451-79b3df8f82-m.jpg) I was fibbing when I said that nothing happened yesterday. There was a whole heap of stuff, but many things are best left unblogged. So lets focus again on the unbelievable self-centredness of the average Italian behind the wheel of a car.

Works are taking place on the road to the station. The pavement is blocked for about 30 metres. Rather than crossing the road, I choose to walk close to the bright orange mesh. This morning a car's wing mirror clipped me as it went past, apparently unable to slow down for even a couple of seconds.
