Good to see that big tech employees feel no need to hide their dirty laundry away. Tim Bray over at Ongoing has an update on the [simple observation that Microsoft's Developer Network website contains horrible code](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/26/Fair-is-Fair). So does Sun, where he works. And IBM. I'm by no means _au fait_ with the technicalities, but it is good to see that people who are, are not afraid to call their bosses to task.

And then there's the Korean TV network that got slammed by viewers and, worse, advertisers, for broadcasting the story of famed stem-cell researcher [Hwang Woo Suk's little ethical problem](http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2005-11-27T090111Z_01_FOR731850_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-KOREA-SCIENCE-DC.XML&archived=False). Fine, fine people, those patriots.

And how nice that the BBC news story about how [science teachers are scared of teaching experiments](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4470148.stm) -- for all the wrong reasons -- features a photo of  -- GASP! -- students not wearing protective goggles.
