[Good news, everyone!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_J._Farnsworth) I managed to upgrade WordPress entirely painlessly. Smooth. Flawless. A dream come true. Except (you knew that was coming) that I can no longer upload pictures to my posts. Dunno why. Voodoo. WordPress admits it's a problem, and I spent much of last night trying everything possible to fix it. But there it is. Flickr, weirdly, now tells me that posts to the blog work, and they do, whereas before it said that the post had failed, but it hadn't. For now, I'll add a little rubric and maybe come back for images later.
