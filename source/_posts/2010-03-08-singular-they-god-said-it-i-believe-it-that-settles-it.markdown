By the way, I see “their” more and more often in the NYTs –not sure if it’s an editorial drift or decision.

Tell the truth, I used to agonize far more about singular they I do now, having been exposed to the infinite wisdom of [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003572.html) (from whom I stole my headline). It isn't just the historical antecedents, it is also the fact that I am more comfortable now breaking the rules, especially ill-founded proscriptive rules. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: Don't, whatever you do, get me started on that bugbear of ill-educated English-speakers, the split infinitive. I'd like to soundly thrash them all. 

 I used to worry; recasting sentences to avoid "he or she," and occasionally using the feminine for effect, and I vividly recall Richard Dawkins doing the same. These days, I'm more concerned that a sentence reads as well as I can make it, although Language Log's [archives on the subject](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?cat=27) provide a handy buttress when I need support.
