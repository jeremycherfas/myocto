Communicatrix may be breaking new ground in the what-to-blog-if-you've-nothing-to-blog-about realm. Not content with that old standby of blogging the search terms people have used to find you (as I am) she's sharing the [sites she has Stumbled Upon](http://www.communicatrix.com/2006/08/stumbleupon.html) using the fine Firefox extension of that name. Of course she has a reason:

> A part of my work, I'm starting to realize, involves copious amounts of play. I get stuck otherwise, in the same books, the same thoughts, the same intake. And since I cannot expect to do anything differently by doing everything the same, Stumble Upon is a great way to change things up, open things up, shake things up.

That makes it work, right?

I've been Stumbling for a while now, but in my case it is pure play, a treat I dangle myself to get through an hour of work-related stupefaction.  Beats looking for girl's privets.

![Twoheadedsnake](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/twoheadedsnake.jpg) Something I did stumble upon (note the careful use of lower case there) is the [St. Louis World Aquarium](http://www.worldaquarium.net/)'s attempt to stage a world-record breaking [exhibit of two-headed animals](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TWO_HEADED_REPTILES?SITE=MOSPL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). Better yet, officials at the zoo are hoping they can persuade a couple of the snakes to make the beast with eight eyes.
