Using the Flickr badge gizmo did not work. But I can create a link to the latest photo [set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/73529121@N00/sets/190973/) reasonably easily. And with a little more work, a photo link to that set.

Like this

[![](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/wp-content/bolt_thumb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/73529121@N00/sets/190973/) Now that's another complicated process, as it stands. And if the bowser window is wide, or if I have not written very much next to the image, then it is going to look awful too as it crashes the title below. But rather than recode all that now, I'm going to seek help. I'll bet someone over at WordPress has written a plug-in to do this kind of thing. Certainly they should have!

Indeed, there are a couple of plug-ins, but they look like overkill to me. Maybe I'll just go with complicated and cumbersome for the time being.
