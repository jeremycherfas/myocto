![Whiteshoes-1](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2006/06/WhiteShoes-1.jpg) So here's the thing. something broke between ecto and WordPress, such that they no longer wanted to play nicely together. And WordPress seemed to think it was ecto's problem. And ecto thought it might be something to do with the server. And the nice folks at TextDrive suggested a possible solution, which I have undertaken, despite my dangerously little knowledge of htaccess files. But there's only one way to find out whether it has worked. I hope so, as the previous nonsense gave me no end of grief.

And Lo! The Gods are Satisfied! Long live [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com) and all who serve her.
