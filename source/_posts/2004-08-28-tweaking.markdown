Just playing about with some colours and stylings. I do prefer Georgia to Times. And larger, and more leading. But I think I want to recreate the look of the old site, not three column, necessarily, but with a more open header and footer, with includes probably. Getting errors on edit. Trying to fix that by not Pinging.
