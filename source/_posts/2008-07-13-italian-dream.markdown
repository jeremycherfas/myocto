An Italian film, with an English title, for reasons best known to director Sandro Baldoni. I suppose it signals the anglophilia of the protagonist. The trailer makes absolutely no sense if you haven't seen the film, and precious little if you have. But maybe Baldoni doesn't feel the need to attract people to his rather good little film.

I suppose it could best be described as a comedy thriller. A man -- night concierge at a fancy hotel -- dreams of opening a restaurant in London. He's a betting man too. And stuff happens to him that makes it seem to us as if he may be having some sort of delusional breakdown. (But this is no Beautiful Mind.) The film is too long. Who cares that the wife tends a pot plant and does the odd spliff at work? And there are several similar peripheral bits and bobs that shed no light on anything. It's a sort of bastard offspring of Trading Places and The Game, with other inputs I'm not alive to. No sign of it yet outside Italy, but could be one to watch for.
