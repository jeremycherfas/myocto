![5971684_1006264745.jpg](/uploads/2008/12/5971684-1006264745.jpg) We got over singing "Blowin' in the wind" instead of Christmas carols, and amazingly found ourselves on [Stubby's Silver Star Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1251369/fullcredits#cast), where The Man forced us to cut our high-concept version of [The Story of Bo Diddley](http://www.actionext.com/names_t/the_animals_lyrics/the_story_of_bo_diddley.html) down to 1'45" or less. And when the votes were in and counted, a girl beat us out with her version of Hernando's Hideaway, which featured a bit of dancing as well as singing.

It was a time of transition, you understand, and Stubby's audience wasn't ready to transition with us. We broke up soon after, to pursue our individual artistic visions.
