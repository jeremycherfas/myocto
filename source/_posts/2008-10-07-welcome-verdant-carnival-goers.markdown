My Berkeley food ruminations took me to [Carnival of the Green](http://sustainablog.org/2008/10/06/carnival-of-the-green-148/), and it is only right and proper that I welcome visitors from there. What did I discover of interest?

Adam, waxing lyrical about [Australian Organic Blood Oranges](http://otibr.com/food/organic-australian-blood-oranges-bloody-delicious/). I know I'm spoilt, but the ones from Sicily that will be appearing in a few weeks are possibly even better. and there's the lottery of produce that hasn't been over-selected, that individual oranges will be good or not-so-good.

And then a very bizarre piece of seeming plagiarism at a site purporting to deliver Own Home Style. [^fn1] The post offers "The cultivation of vegetables" and is preceded by the following bizarre disclaimer:

I did, I did, and it is ancient stuff lifted from any number of sources. I know recycling is green, but come on? This kind of crapola needs reducing. To zero.


[^fn1]: I'm not bothering to link to it for obvious reasons.
