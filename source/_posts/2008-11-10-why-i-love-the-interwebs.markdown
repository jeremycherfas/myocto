[Big white Chiclets are the dental equivalent of the full Cleveland.](http://www.deepglamour.net/deep_glamour/2008/08/aaron-sorokin-s.html) Now I know what a Full Cleveland is.

### And this is why I hate the interwebs

Because they seem too true. I was congratulating myself yesterday for going to the [FUKUA](http://www.ikea.com/) website to check the dimensions on a little bit of Ivar that I fancy, when I noticed I could also check availability. Whoa Nellie! None in stock at the store I normally go to. Check other store, to which I have never been. Alright! 143 pieces in stock, today and for the next two days. [^fn1] It even tells me what shelf the thing is on.

We discussed this over morning cappucino, my friend and I. We agreed that this was both wonderful and trivial, a perfect use of the interwebs. Ikea opens up its system so that its customers can do the work of sales representatives, saving the company money -- nobody having to answer phones to dumb questions about stocks -- and making the customers feel smart and savvy into the bargain.

When I got there, they were out of stock. None expected, said the sales representative, whose time I shamelessly wasted.

[^fn1]: Presumably this is a slow moving item.
