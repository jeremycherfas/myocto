This post is addressed to people in the US. Even those we know personally, who are mostly very sensible.

Why have Fox and CBS [banned the new flying pig Trojan commercial](http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/06/fox_and_cbs_reject_trojan_cond.php)?


  1. Because they think unwanted pregnancy is A Good Thing?
  2. Because they think abortion is A Good Thing?
  3. Because they think the morning after pill is A Good Thing?
  4. Because it contains the word "evolve"?
  5. Because they are total numbnuts who wouldn't recognize A Good Thing if it rushed up and squeezed both cheeks until their eyes watered?
  6. All of the above?
  7. None of the above? (In which case, for pity's sake, why?)
And, for bonus points, why is anybody watching those channels anyway?
