Run, don't walk, to watch [Richard Dawkins deal with Stephen Colbert](http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/10/colbert_dawkins.html#comments).

This is the second time I've seen Richard deal with a Stephen, and by far the funnier of the two. The other time the Stephen came off as pathetic. Indeed, scales fell from my eyes. (I must see if I can find the little thing I wrote about that, a while back.)
