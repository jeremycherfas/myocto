Yay! The Communicatrix just launched another of her [21-Day Salutesâ„¢](http://www.communicatrix.com/tag/21-day-salutes%e2%84%a2). This one seems to be focused on sucking less at life. Or maybe about figuring out why she sucks at somethings. Or maybe about feeling OK about some suckiness. Not very focused, I hear you say. Yeah, well, that's my inability to nail it down.

I've come to the new salute 4 days late, which means I have a bit of catching up to do, but I know it will be worth it, most of the time anyway. [Start here](http://www.communicatrix.com/2008/04/stop-sucking-day01.html).
