Just a little post to see whether I have made the migration successfully.

_Later_: Alas not. I thought I had followed the instructions to the letter, but when the time came to check, blank page blues. I did a ton of things short of actually slaughtering a large cock, but to no effect. So, we're back at square one, and I will try again in the next couple of days.

I think my plan should be to clean out all the cruft in the existing setup, and then transfer, rather than the other way round, in the hope that the less the cruft, the less the opportunity for something to go wrong.

It'd be nice to have a way of cleaning up all the various image links. At the moment they are horribly all over the place. Need to research that.

_Later still_: Might have worked this time. And you know what? Server seems faster. Or perhaps that's just self-justification.
