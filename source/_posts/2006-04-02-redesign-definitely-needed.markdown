There are a couple of things about this site that really need working on, design wise. The fiasco this evening, as I tried and failed to get the previous post to display gracefully, has convinced me that I am just not good enough to code a truly liquid centre-column into my CSS. I need to think really hard about how to proceed. I could go for an overhaul and try to find a way to make images in the centre column do what I want them to do (float left, but relate to the text alongside in ways that are hard to classify because the height of the text depends completely on the width of the centre column). Or find another layout, probably with a fixed width, and tweak it to my liking.

Like I said, though, both options really need fully functional fingers.
