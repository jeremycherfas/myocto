I had a lot of trouble trying to combine a Ken Burns gentle zoom with static framing after the zoom. It is easy enough to split a clip and apply Ken Burns to the first clip. The problem is getting the crop in the second clip to match exactly with the End framing of the first clip.

Does that make sense?

I finally figured out how to do this. Do the Ken Burns on the whole clip before splitting. Then split the clip where you want the zoom to stop. Now, in the second clip, switch the End framing (red) with the Start framing (Green). Now click on Crop. The second clip will be cropped to the same degree as the end of your zoom on the first clip, and the transition will be invisible.

I couldn't find any answers to this question, and so I thought I would share what I had discovered, in case someone else wants to do the same.
