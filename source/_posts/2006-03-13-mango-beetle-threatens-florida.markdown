![311Xinlinegallery](/uploads/2006/03/311xInlineGallery.jpg) Today's guest, left, is _Rhytidodera bowringii_, a beetle that has "decimated mango plantations". A single live specimen was detained on its way in to Miami. [The news](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/science/3715799.html) was released on 10 March.

Two days later, the New York Times publishes a [swingeing attack](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2006/03/12/its-an-ill-wind/) on Florida mangoes. 
Coincidence? I think not. I look forward to a ransom note from Madhur Jaffrey.
