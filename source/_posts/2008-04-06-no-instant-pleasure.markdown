![K42Bye9G](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/k42bye9g.jpg) Even though I conduct all my gardening these days in silly little pots, I'm aware of how much I like the anticipation. A big blooming bush is instant bliss, but often leads to heartbreak as the plant struggles to cope with conditions outside the pampered nursery environment. Going out every morning to check on newly emerged leaves, or waiting for a shoot to poke its head above the compost, is a slower pleasure but, in the end, a more satisfying one. Watching a plant grow and change is a big part of what I like. Even in little pots.
