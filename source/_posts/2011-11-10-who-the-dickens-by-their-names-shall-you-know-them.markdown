> George Eliot, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Henry James, Dickens, Thackeray, Hans Christen Anderson, Longfellow, Stendhal: all spent time in this city, for a short season or to live. Most of them wrote about Rome, in travel memoirs or fiction. Rome in literature was as hard to avoid as the foreign writers in her streets.


Gulping down an interesting [antidote to Bella Roma, Caput mundi, Citta Eterna](http://www.themillions.com/2011/11/de-romanticizing-rome.html) (thanks [Cal](http://5cense.com/)) I was struck by the list reproduced above, and spent way too much time trying to work out whether there was any logic to it, or whether it was just euphony at play. OK, Eliot needs a specific, but Hawthorne doesn't? Twain obviously doesn't, but always gets one. Elsewhere in the piece Byron gets his honorific and Shelley his two forenames, [^fn1]
