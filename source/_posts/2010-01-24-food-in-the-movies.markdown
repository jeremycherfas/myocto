Great round-up in The Smart Set of [food in the movies](http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article01221001.aspx). Paula Marantz Cohen romps through the classics -- Leave the gun, take the cannoli -- and brings out both their individual flavour and the way each has influenced some of its successors. I haven't seen them all, something I would make amends for if it weren't so darned difficult to rent decent movies in this country. Is anything missing? Only one that sprang immediately to mind, and that's the ubiquitous [^fn1] Alberto Sordi eating maccheroni in _[Un americano a Roma](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046705/)_.

[^fn1]: Literally. The print is in so many restaurants that a friend once commented that it was probably the local equivalent of a health and safety notice certifying that the establishment was licensed to serve food.
