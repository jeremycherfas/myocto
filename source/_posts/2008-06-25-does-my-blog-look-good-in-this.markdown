No, not [food porn](http://habeasbrulee.com/2008/06/09/results-does-my-blog-look-good-in-this-may-2008/). Just a growing fedupness with the old look. That was itself decluttered from the earlier version and the new look is even simpler. But still, I hope, attractive.

Much has been removed; the judgement calls, the list of recent comments (sad in its slow turnover) the recent photos, the recent posts. I'm still sucking it to see whether some of those might make a comeback, and there may be other things I want to add.

Any and all comments welcome, honest.
