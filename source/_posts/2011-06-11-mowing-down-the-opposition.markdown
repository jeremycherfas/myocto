You can turn anything into a competitive endeavour, it seems, even the contemplative, mindful here-and-nowness of scything, [which I have long loved](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/05/19/nettles/). 




I miss my scythes (yes, plural). [^fn1]

(And in case you were wondering whatever happened to Nettle Awareness Week, it has apparently been relaunched as [Be Nice to Nettles Week](http://www.nettles.org.uk/) and seems to be more or less [moribund](http://www.workingwithwildlife.co.uk/).)
