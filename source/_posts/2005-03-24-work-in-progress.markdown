I've spent a little time working on the photoblog, which you get to at the moment just by clicking on the thumbnail to the right. Driving it is a superb little package called [PixelPost](http://pixelpost.org/), which is just great for the simplest kind of photoblog. I've spent most of the evening getting into the way its templates and stylesheets are structured and trying to strait-jacket them into my existing site design. I can't think why, really. I suppose because it saves having to think about a new design. Anyway, I'm by no means finished, and haven't even started on the browser page, but it isn't too ugly and so I'm going to leave that template in place.

I've also been thinking in a bit more detail about how I want to deal with photos up here, but those thoughts are still somewhat inchoate, and not ready for consumption. Or implementation.
