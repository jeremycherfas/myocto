I cannot remember the last time I paid money to see a Bond film. There were a couple I couldn't avoid on TV, and one that helped to pass the time of day on a flight. But actual money? Not since the main purpose was a snog in the back row. Yesterday, however, buoyed a bit by the buzz, I laid my money down for Casino Royale, and I'm very glad I did. Excellent stuff; unbelievable (of course) but not incredible. Gail (who has asked Santa for a glove compartment defibrillator) got it spot on when she said "It's so good to have done with the whiz-bang gadgetry". [Rolling Stone's review](http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7349978/review/12450444/casino_royale), to which she pointed me, sums it up just fine for both of us. 

My rating: 4 out of 5
