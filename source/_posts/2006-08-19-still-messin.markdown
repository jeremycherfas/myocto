Not a lot of progress with the restyle, but I am slowly getting there. I think. Photos are back up, but look terrible. And I have little line of recent photos across the bottom above the "sidebar". But there's still plenty to be done.

OK, so it is now Sunday morning -- don't fret, I did sleep, and watch a movie -- and I am a lot happier. Still a fair bit of tweaking to do, but it is just that, tweaking.
