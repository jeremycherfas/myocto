The BBC interviewed a cabbie instead of [Guy Kewney](http://www.newswireless.net/). If only I'd been there, I could have told them they had the wrong bloke, and that the man in question was not my old mucker Guy.

p.s. Note to The [Mail on Sunday](http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=386136&in_page_id=1770&in_page_id=1770), which carried the story: wise up. WMV files are so not useful. [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scvOLr0-CiY&search=guy%20kewney) is the way to go.

Later ...
p.p.s [The whole story](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm), revealed by the BBC. He wasn't a cabbie. And his name was Guy.
