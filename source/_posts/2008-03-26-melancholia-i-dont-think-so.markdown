"Really? I don't feel it."
"No, not you right now, your blog. It seems sad. And what's all that about giving and happiness?"
"I think I know what you mean. But I don't think it's melancholy."
"You seem to want something, to be ... missing something?" With that rising question mark intonation.
"Maybe you're right. Maybe I just want to get some satisfaction from the things I have to do, rather than just from the things I do in between the things I have to do."
