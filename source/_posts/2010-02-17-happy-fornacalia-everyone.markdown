I can't actually be sure that today is the day, because the [Curio Maximus](http://abacus.bates.edu/~mimber/Rciv/fornicalia.htm) hasn't actually announced it. But today is the last day it could possibly be. So I'm celebrating in the simplest possible way, by baking bread with only three ingredients: flour, water and salt. Oh, and the squillions of things that bestir my 100% hydration natural leaven.

Still, better than the [Italian](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornacalia). And then there are the supremely puzzling links between [Fornax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax_%28mythology%29), Goddess of the Oven, [^fn1]

[fornices](http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_prostitutionnotes2.htm#Fornix), where one could hire a hot babe, [fornices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornix) cerebral and otherwise, and [fornication](http://sacred-sex.org/terminology/fornication). ((Don't trust Wikipedia on this etymology either. 

 Not to mention buns in ovens. The modern constellation [Fornax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax) is clearly of little relevance. One could, however, clearly spend a lifetime exploring these particular rabbit holes.
