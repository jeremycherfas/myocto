Before this morning I might have read today's BBC piece about [Aids in Africa](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6166530.stm) and given a world-weary sigh for those poor people. But this morning, via the [Freakonomics blog](http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/11/20/emily-oster-girl-genius/), I read Emily Oster's piece in the December Esquire magazine: [Three Things You Don't Know About Aids In Africa](http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2006/061105_mfe_December_06_Oster.html).

And now I know that: Aids is not the disease to be worrying about; an end to poverty will stop Aids faster than just about anything else; the UN's figures -- peg for the BBC -- are way too pessimistic but, and this is the really bad news, the rate of spread is as fast as it ever was.

All I need to do now, of course, is to read [her original papers](http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/papers.html).
