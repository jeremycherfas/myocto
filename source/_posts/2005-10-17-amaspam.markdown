> As someone who has bought some great CDs from us, we thought you might be interested in some of the fantastic music that's coming this season. There's something to suit all tastes with big albums from the likes of Robbie Williams, The Prodigy, Madonna, Depeche Mode and even Kate Bush, all from Â£8.49.

Targeted marketing to take me deep into the Long Tail I can stand. This I cannot. Smells like something close to spam.
