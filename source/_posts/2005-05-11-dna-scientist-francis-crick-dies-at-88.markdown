[        Obituary](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/wire/sns-ap-obit-crick,1,4969553.story?coll=sns-ap-science-headlines&ctrack=1&cset=true)

> Nobel Prize-winning scientist Francis Crick, who co-discovered the spiral, "double-helix" structure of DNA in 1953 and opened the way for everything from gene-spliced crops and medicines to DNA fingerprinting and the genetic detection of diseases, has died. He was 88.
