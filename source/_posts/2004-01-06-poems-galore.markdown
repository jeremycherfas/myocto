While I don't exactly agree with the ostensible reason for [Plagiarist.com](http://plagiarist.com/poetry/)'s existence (but see also [Plagiarism.com)](http://www.plagiarism.com/), it is a very handy site for finding a copy of a poem in a hurry. Google sent me there to find some e.e. cummings and I did.
