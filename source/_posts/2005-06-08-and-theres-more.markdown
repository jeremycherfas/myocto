Thanks National Geographic, for a [photo](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0607_050607_fishapron.html) of the [fish smuggling apron](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2005/06/07/surprise/).

Department of strange coincidences:

> The survey at St Thomas's Hospital found just 14 per cent of women had an orgasm every time they had sex and 14 per cent had never experienced one.

Yes, they're at it again, seeking [reasons to be cheerful](http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=627022005). "The new research is likely to be interpreted as both good and bad news," says China's news agency [Xinhuanet](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/08/content_3057818.htm). Can't argue with that.

And what goes around comes around. A zoo in Germany is under fire for putting [grass-skirted black men](http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=627152005) into mud huts to display rhinos and elephants "in their natural environment". I know other zoos got into this kind of display around 150 years ago, when we were all so much less sensitive, and I've a feeling the great [Carl Hagenbeck](http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/zoos/fullsize/sil24-043-01.jpg) himself, effectively the inventor of the modern zoo at [Hamburg](http://www.hagenbeck.de/), may have done the same.
