I can do no better than to flagrantly copy [this piece](http://www.weeklyworldinquisitor.com/aliens/index.php?pagemode=display&ref=31&PHPSESSID=11ddf73a2029ba9b0dc12d1b329cd740)'s headline as my own and send you there to read the original report. "Only the best, most natural crops are good enough for aliens." From the Weekly World Inquisitor -- motto: we waste no time in seeking the truth -- a genetically engineered Onion.
