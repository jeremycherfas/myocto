Just having a little play with the sidebar (which is down the bottom rather than to one side, but no matter). There's a spiffy WordPress plugin called [Comment Remix](http://pressography.com/plugins/wp-comment-remix/) that lets you do good things, like display the latest comments at the top, rather than at the bottom, and makes it easier to reply to specific comments and to quote from comments. It also lets me display latest comments in a slightly friendlier fashion. At least, I think it does.

But, see those little pictures next to each commenter? Those are Gravatars. I used to think they were useless baubles, but I've discovered that actually they make it easier to recognize who is saying what, even when the image isn't a face. [^fn1] And the nice thing about Gravatars is that once you have enabled one -- by going to [www.gravatar.org](http://en.gravatar.com/) --  it is available in all sorts of places. So, if you don't want to be a faceless silhouette, go and do it.

[^fn1]: I could wax evolutionary about that, and suggest that our skill at recognizing faces is so great that we can easily associate any image with a personality, but I won't.
