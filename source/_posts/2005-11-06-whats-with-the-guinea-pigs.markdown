My ego knowing no bounds I recently installed a spiffy web analyzer called [Slimstat](http://wettone.com/code/slimstat). There were problems -- aren't there always? -- but eventually I got it up and running and could see how few people were visiting my site. Then I had to reinstall it, because I had messed up the first time. Now I see that every single visitor this morning has come from Google Images in search of guinea-pigs. They came in English, Australian, Danish and Korean. What they found when they got here was a terrible snap that I stole from a poster in Peru when I had occasion [to eat one of the little blighters](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2004/09/22/lunch/). I do hope they weren't too upset.
