Er, would you mind signing this bit of paper here please? I'd hate anyone to think I was taking advantage of you.


> The aim of the campaign is really to stop young men taking advantage of drunken women and having sex with them  [Danny Shaw BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4780992.stm)

That Shaw boy surely has a way with words. Which reminds me of a quote I saw in a [review in the New Statesman](http://www.newstatesman.com/Bookshop/300000111056).


> Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. C.S. Lewis.

So girls, if you don't want to have sex with appalling men who would take advantage of a legless drunk -- remembering that most men will fuck mud -- my advice is: don't become a legless drunk.
