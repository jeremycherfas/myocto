Read the whole of [Helen DeWitt's essay here](http://paperpools.blogspot.com/2007/08/cormac-mccarthy-semi-colon.html). And remind me to read something else by her. I really liked [The Last Samurai](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0786887001%26tag=adriaantijsse-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0786887001%253FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2).
