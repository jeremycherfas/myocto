Daniel Mosquin is a working scientist. He maintains a wonderful blog [Botany Photo of the Day](http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/potd/). The blog contains science. It ranks at 35 on the Technorati scheme that Nature used to puff the [top 50 science blogs](http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/full/442009a.html). But it isn't in that list. I confess. I didn't notice. And Daniel is very magnanimous about being left off the list: "Ah well," he [writes](http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/potd/2006/07/lilium_columbianum.php), "I still recommend visiting the science weblogs on the list â€“ many gems in there."
