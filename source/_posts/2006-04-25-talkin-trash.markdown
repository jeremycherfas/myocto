> As my wife says, rational people are not threatened by fantasy books about supernatural powers. They know how to separate fact from fiction. They use logic, reason and critical thinking as their tools. It is the people who believe in magical powers and the supernatural that are threatened.

There's no point in my addressing the loopy woman who, as a Christian, one who pays taxes no less, wants to ban the Harry Potter books from her school library system. Not when The Viscount LaCarte has already [done so with such eloquence](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/2006/04/do-you-believe-in-magic.html).
