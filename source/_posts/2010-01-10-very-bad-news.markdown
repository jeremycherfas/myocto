Conflicted, moi? One of the best TV dramas evah, being remade with one of the greatest plonkers evah in the starring role. [Edge of Darkness](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/edge/) redefined thrillers on BBC television, with astonishing performances from Bob Peck and Joe Don Baker and Eric Clapton's soundtrack to die for. Now the same director is [remaking it for the big screen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226273/). Can Mel Gibson and Ray Winstone do it? I really don't know. I do know I'm not inclined to pay money to see Mr Gibson in anything.
