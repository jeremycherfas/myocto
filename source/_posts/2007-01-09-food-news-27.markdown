Start: 95.4 Last week: 188 This week: 90.1
**Tuesday 9 January:** Back on home turf for a few days now and the bad news is that my regular scales are definitely up on those of The Squeeze. I seem to have gone up 2kg in the past month, which is less than the mythical 7 pounds that the average person (in North America?) apparently puts on each Kwanzaa, and should be easy enough to cope with. It is also a little dispiriting that I seem to have stopped listening to my hunger. got out of the habit, I suppose. I catch myself snacking when I really had no need to. Ah well. I may need to take specific action to get moving down again, but for now I plan to just settle down and see what happens.
