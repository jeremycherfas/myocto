One of the nice things about not being on holiday (perhaps the only one) is that I have access to all the techie tools I need to make posting here a breeze. In which spirit, my favourite list of 2005: [The Year in Media Errors and Corrections](http://www.regrettheerror.com/2005/12/crunks_05_the_y.html). The parent site looks worth bookmarking for future entertainment.
