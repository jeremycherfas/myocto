![3186170 20Facc785B T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/3186170-20facc785b-t.jpg) The average academic-style seminar is a tar-pit for the unwary. The questions are fraught with baggage and meaning. I'm smarter than you are, and that's why I'm asking this question. I'm thick as pigshit [^fn1] and I don't even know it, and that's why I'm asking this question. I know why you're asking that question, and that's why I'm going to do my best to avoid answering it. My question's sub-text on a minor detour was "how can you possibly think that?" But I let it slide.

[^fn1]: Why do we say this? In my experience, pigshit is generally on the runny side, not at all thick.
