It's a scandal! Jonathan Eisen says that Hollywood is making a movie tentatively entitled [Tree of Life](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2008/06/tree-of-life-hitting-big-screen.html). Plot summary?

> 
  
> 
> In a mystical world of folklore, several individuals embrace in a race to find the Tree of Life, said to give immortality, fertility, and other supernatural powers.
> 
> 

Eisen wants to [protect this holiest of holy phrases](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2008/06/calling-all-evolutionary-biologists.html) from the attention of a gazillion celebrity-sucking bloggers etc who, he fears, will cause "uses of the Tree of Life by evolutionary biologists [to] lose their google rankings. The term "The Tree of Life" is at risk of a form of extinction."

And the solution? Link to the real McCoys. Which I'm happy to do.

I do, however, need someone to explain to me just when "fertility" became a supernatural power.
