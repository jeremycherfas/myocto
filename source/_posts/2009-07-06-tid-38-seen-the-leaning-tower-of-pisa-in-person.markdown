Many times. Parochial bloody list. But I can't think what a good version of this activity ought to be for people who don't live in Europe. Been in the Statue of Liberty's head? Had your supper stolen by a gull at the Sydney Opera House? Walked across the Grand Coolee Dam? That's the odd thing about other people's lives compared to one's own. Their humdrum is potentially my exotic, and vice versa. I've never really understood that thing about walking a mile (or five) in another man's moccasins, but doing his daily chores might be interesting, at least for a while.
