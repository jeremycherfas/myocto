[![Doonesbury 2 7 2006 Clip-1](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2006/07/Doonesbury%202_7_2006_clip-1.jpg)](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2006/07/Doonesbury-2_7_2006.jpg) Yesterday's Doonesbury is not funny, antibiotic resistance being one of the great unappreciated squandered commons. Well, actually it is, of course. Very. But I wonder how many people will witter on about "change within a species" and continue living a life that makes no sense except in the light of natural selection?

Later ...
Ooops. It has come to my attention that yesterday's strip was "[a repeat that was first run back in December](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/in_the_funny_pages.php)". But that's OK, because the loss of antibiotic susceptibility is also a repeat, and a more frequent one than Doonesbury.
