> The ancient heirloom Italian grain called farro is enjoying a resurgence of popularity in the U.S.

Actually, compared to most of the tosh one reads on the subject, this does indeed sort out the confusion, a bit. One thing to remember is not so much that Italian farmers use the word "farro" to describe the three main kinds of hulled wheats, but that they are often grown (and thus eaten) as a mixture. Another is that the notion of a smooth progress from ancient wheat varieties to modern ones is a little misleading. Today's farro is certainly not genetically identical to the farro on which the legions of Rome marched, and has itself evolved and adapted over time.
