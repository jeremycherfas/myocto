![305750775 98Ccc6Ad2E M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/305750775-98ccc6ad2e-m.jpg) I had A Big Idea yesterday. This is bad because it reminds me of my deficiencies. I am not a risk-taker. I've never second-mortgaged the house to invest in a dream of riches. I'm lazy, seldom managing to avoid the lure of a nap. I'd rather be with someone than working a lonely furrow on into the dawn. And I like to be comfortable, in a warm, dry abode with decent furniture and good things. My past is littered with Good Ideas. This time, I've placed a help wanted ad. No replies just yet.
