Facebook's most recent set of changes prompted me to explore [Google+](http://plus.google.com/117370192660207004661/posts) and if nothing else it is a lot easier on the eye, probably because I don't have all that many circle members, or whatever they're called, yet. Of course, ultimately one wants everything duplicated everywhere [^fn1]
[^fn1]: Or not. 

 so I wandered over to my curated topic at [Scoop.it](http://www.scoop.it/t/food-and-nutrition) to click on that fine service's G+ button to see what that does. 

It sticks the link in G+! 

So far so good, but … the link it inserts takes you not to the original item, but back to Scoop.it, which may be fine for them [^fn1]
[^fn1]: I realize that with Scoop, as with G+ and FB and almost everything else that's "free", I am not the customer. 

 but ticks me right off. The Scoop RSS feed does the same thing. Daft, really. Scoop says it can't really be bothered to develop a more useful RSS structure, and the API is there for all who want to take advantage of that kind of stuff, but while I might be able to develop the smarts to do that, I don't really have the time or the inclination. What's the answer? Probably do what I did before Scoop implemented its G+ button, and share the URI directly. I'll do the work, so you don't have to. 

Because content curation is like love …
