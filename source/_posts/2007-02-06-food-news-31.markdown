Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.1 This week: 88.1**
Tuesday 6 February:** Things seem to be settling down again, but not a lot to report. On the bread front, a no-knead sourdough failed to rise much. Possibly the starter was a bit old. I'll have to make another batch sooner rather than later, while ploughing my way through the rest of the brick. But a banana bread made last night seems to be delicious. "Seems" because I managed not to dive straight in for a still-warm slice, which is still somewhat surprising to me. This despite having to convert ludicrous American measures into something a little easier to use. I was happy to discover that one of my cups is an 8 oz. cup. But really, why do they do it?
