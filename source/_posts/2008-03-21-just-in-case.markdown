![64534096 302Da6C6C4 T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/64534096-302da6c6c4-t.jpg) I used to write a column, every fortnight, from an ex-Commonwealth country for a London-based magazine. Pre-email. Fax difficult. Copy delivered airmail. One day my editor called.

"Where's your copy?"

"I sent it a week ago."

"It hasn't arrived."

"Bugger. OK, I'll give it to a copy-taker. Is there someone free?"

"In a minute. But before that, I suppose we ought to have a spare on hand."

"Yes."

So I wrote two pieces that fortnight, one timely, as ever, one less so, and we rotated out the spare every three months or so.
