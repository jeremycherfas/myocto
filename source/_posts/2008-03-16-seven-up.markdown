![390651391 Dc79863Ae0 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/390651391-dc79863ae0-m.jpg) It is a truism that if you want something done, give it to someone who is already busy. Just as a deadline tomorrow is easier to meet than a week next Friday, if you've already got a bunch of stuff to deal with, one more small enough thing hardly makes a difference. That's how it has been with my [self-inflicted lunacy](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2008/03/when-in-rome-50.html). Since promising myself I'd do these damnable little things every day, I've also done a whole lot more besides. Deciding to have an image per post just makes it harder, and therefor weirdly easier.
