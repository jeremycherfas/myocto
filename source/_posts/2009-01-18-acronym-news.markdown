I have a friend who identifies closely with [wombats](http://wombatdiet.net/). Catching up on [magazine reading](http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12863573), I wonder whether he knew it was an acronym for Waste Of Money, Brains And Time? Somehow, and given aspects of our shared past, I feel he must have.
