![220251479 1399673Fdd M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/220251479-1399673fdd-m.jpg) Giving makes me happy, and the size of the gift makes no difference to the amount of happiness it engenders. So why don't I take every opportunity that presents itself to give happiness?

There's a young woman stationed down the hill from the supermarket entrance. She's well-kept, presentable, seems cheerful and is always polite. I've ever given her anything. I think it's because she's there all day, every day. It's her job, and yet she "does" nothing but sit. Rewarding that would give me no pleasure. She must be capable of something -- anything -- more.
