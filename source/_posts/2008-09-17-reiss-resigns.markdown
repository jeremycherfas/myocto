I'm late to the news that [Michael Reiss has resigned](http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?id=8008) [^fn1]
 as Director of Education at the Royal Society. PZ has compiled the important bits (The RoySoc's announcement and Richard Dawkins'' response) over at [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/royal_society_statement_regard.php). The best bit is the way Dawkins handles the whole issue of accommodationism (would appeasement be an easier word?). Dawkins concludes:

> Perhaps, rather than resign his job with the Royal Society, Professor Reiss might consider resigning his Orders?

And PZ adds:

> Let us ask, though, if these brave paladins of Jesus-compatible science would be willing to set aside their religion to better endorse scienceâ€¦and I think we all know what the answer would be.

Amen to that, bros.
