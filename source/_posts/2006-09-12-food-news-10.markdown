Start: 95.4 Last week: 88.9  This week: 88.1
**Tuesday 12 September:** Still dropping steadily. For a while there I thought I was on one of them dreaded plateaux, with three days straight at an unwavering 88.5. Then a bit of a blow-out at the weekend and an increase, and now a litle drop. Some people over on the SLD forums seem to think there's a pattern there, that a drop often comes after a blow-out. Could be.
