I just love the idea of the River Plate's armpit. The real thing's not bad either. The [restoration](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/06/wfountain06.xml) of Bernini's fountain at the centre of the Piazza Navona should be fun to watch. Especially after it is done, when small electric shock pads will, authorities hope, keep pigeons away.
