Skipping by some old buddies I note that [The Viscount LaCarte](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/2007/04/creation-science-101.html) posted this a coupla Fridays ago without yielding to the temptation to say just exactly which Friday it was. Good man. Anyway, this little number tickled me, so I offer it to you.

And my new project is to learn how to post directly from YouTube. I tried, but so far nothing has appeared, and I have no idea why not.
