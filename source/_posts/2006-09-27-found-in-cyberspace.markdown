After yesterday's [unpleasant little moan](http://jeremycherfas.net/2006/09/26/lost-in-cyberspace/) about the difficulties of geotagging, cyberspace has made everything more or less right again. First off, Jeffrey Early, author of [GPSPhotoLinker](http://oregonstate.edu/~earlyj/gpsphotolinker/), took the time to deal with my queries and suggest strongly that I complain to iView. I will, but now that they are owned by Microsoft I'm not all that optimistic.

I had also posted a comment at [High Earth Orbit](http://highearthorbit.com/), which has lots of good info about geotagging, in response to a post about [how to geotag Flickr photos](http://highearthorbit.com/geotagging-flickr-photos-the-right-way/) "the right way". Andrew Turner, the author, was kind enough to reply, pointing me to [PictureSync](http://holocore.com/?PictureSync), an uploader that supports many image sharing web sites beyond Flickr. I downloaded 1.5, but that kept giving me an error, so I tried the 1.6 beta and that worked like a charm. I uploaded one test image (another _Plumeria_, of course), all the tags got through, and it appeared on my map automagically.

Andrew also had an interesting suggestion for GPSPhotolinker, to make it more usable when one does not have a GPS machine to supply a track:

> What I would like is if GPSPL allowed me to set & store locations and then later assign those locations - or a simple interface to build a "fake" track file (I type in where I was at what times, from calendar, memory, tickets, etc) that is then used.

That seems like a great idea, although there are actually lots of other tools out there that will allow you to add geographic information to a photo in other ways. [Semaflickr](http://semaflickr.sohne.net/flickr/sign_in) is one of the more interesting ones, although it only works for photos already on Flickr and only uses Flickr's very non-standard geotags. And [maloXP](http://zitronengras.twoday.net/) suggested a [bookmarklet](http://typolis.net/sumaato/stories/4323/) that claims to make geotagging even easier within Flickr; I have not needed to try that, but it is good to know it exists.

So it seems like I'm all set. And I am definitely abandoning Fickr Uploadr in favour of PictureSync. You should too.
