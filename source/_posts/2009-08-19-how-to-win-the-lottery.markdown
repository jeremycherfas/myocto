I know all about how lotteries are in general a tax on stupidity, hope, desperation, etc. etc. I also know that Italy's SuperEnalotto jackpot currently stands at â‚¬143,000,000. That's a lot of money in anybody's currency. I'm not saying it would make me happy, because we all know that money can't buy happiness. [^fn1] Even a small part of it would, however, reduce some of the uncertainty that currently makes full contentment elusive. And I know exactly how to win this lottery.

I'm going to buy a ticket. Maybe 5.
