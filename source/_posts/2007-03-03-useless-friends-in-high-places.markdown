No less a gardener than [Prince Charles](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/03/ncharles03.xml) (of England) does not like the [EU seed marketing](http://agro.biodiver.se/2007/02/how-the-european-common-catalogue-destroys-biodiversity/) legislation, and admits that he could be considered a criminal for saving and distributing unregistered varieties. I have not seen any comments from him on the [proposals for the future](http://agro.biodiver.se/2007/02/future-prospects-for-european-crop-varieties/). But his opinion carries not the slightest bit of weight with the regulators, I promise. I wonder whether he has seen my own [modest proposal](http://jeremycherfas.net/2007/02/28/what-i-would-like-europe-to-do-about-agricultural-biodiversity/)? Probably not.

(Oooh, but the things I could tell you ...)
