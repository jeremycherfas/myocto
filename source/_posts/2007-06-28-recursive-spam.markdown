[![Spam-In-Outlook](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/Spam-in-Outlook-tm.jpg)](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/Spam-in-Outlook.jpg) 

I'm totally freaked by this. I don't often check the spam box in my Outlook at work. But when I did, yesterday, there was, like, the report from the official work Spam filter. Click on the pic above for a full-size view, if you need proof of a sort. Really. I mean, like, how did it know? Not that I can ever be bothered to check the Quarantine report either, but still, if I wanted to, would I think to look for it in the spam bin? I think not.
