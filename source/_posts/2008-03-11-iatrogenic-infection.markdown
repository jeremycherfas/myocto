[![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/31/56181603_97b1d869e4_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mittensohmy/56181603/) This thing I have undertaken, it isn't really a meme. Nobody tagged me. I infected myself. And I'm still not sure why. Possibly because I know that I have been neglecting this blog of late. So what? Well, I don't feel good about that. Not because I feel a duty to you, loyal reader, but because I am letting myself down. I've written all I can for the day, I say. But that cannot be true. And so, preferably without cheating and stacking things up, I plan to write something every day. Until I'm cured.
