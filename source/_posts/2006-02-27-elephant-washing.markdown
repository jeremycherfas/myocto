I'm actually just testing this to see how blogging from Flickr works. It would save masses of time and effort (both of which are in short supply) to be able to do this kind of thing.

Later ... Odd. Flickr said that I had failed. But I had not. Looks ghastly, of course, but that's easy to fix. Must check this out. But not now.
