[Arlington Road](http://imdb.com/title/tt0137363/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9YXJsaW5ndG9uIHJvYWR8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxzYz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1) has Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges in it; what's not to like? The heavy-handedness and plethora of hints that all is not what it seems. That old saw "Just because you're paranoid ..." gets a good working over, and the end is something of a surprise, in a movie-making industry addicted to resolution. But I'm glad I didn't spend real money on this one. 

My rating: 2 out of 5
