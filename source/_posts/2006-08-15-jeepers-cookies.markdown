Astounded by the news (_via_ [Harper's Weekly](http://www.harpers.org/WeeklyReview2006-08-15.html)) that one of the poor saps whose AOL internet searches had been revealed for all the world to see had been looking for easter cookie recipe for jesus' suffering," I popped that sucker into Google. And you know what? [There is such a thing](http://grandpaboy.blogspot.com/2006/03/jesus-christ-ashton-kutcher.html)! One of the commenters thought it "no wonder so many kids grow up to be atheists". But alas, not enough of them do.

Speaking of which, they're still coming here in search of girls privets. Just wish I had something to make it worth their while.
