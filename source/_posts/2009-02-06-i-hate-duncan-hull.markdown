Because he pointed me to this video.

And now I'm being sucked into a vortex of appalling "scientific" music videos. Alas, the "[making](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dPV0FQOaI&feature=related)" video to accompany that wonderful effort above doesn't give any of the details I truly want. are those all employees of the company? How many have PhDs. Is it a loving parody, or sincerely dreadful? And who wrote those lyrics, especially "PCR, When you need to find out who the daddy is"?
