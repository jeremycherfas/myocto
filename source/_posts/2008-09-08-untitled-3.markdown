[You probably don't have time for coffee, whereas with a Microsoft installation you have time for dinner or a trip to the cinema.](http://wombatdiet.net/2008/09/05/asus-eee-pc-1000-with-ubuntu-chrome-an-inflection-point/) Oh no! I think I may have machine-envy. The Wombat has an Asus EEE PC 1000. But, how good is the keyboard?

Phew! So that's alright then. I can just keep waiting for the full-size keyboard that will work with an iPod touch.
