For a Very Big Cheese in the world of web design and CSS, Dunstan Orchard is clearly not in the least bit insecure. His Flickr [photostream](http://flickr.com/photos/dunstan/sets/679108/) of Things I Found While Tidying Up is a wonderful glimpse into his life. I'd considered something similar while moving here, but didn't in the end have time. Now it'll seem derivative if I do. Have to rethink. But I do have an [autograph book](http://flickr.com/photos/dunstan/30343488/in/set-679108/) just like his, coloured pages and all, and I'm wondering whether there might not be an unmet need for an autograph book group on Flickr.
