I love what happens when I put iTunes into shuffle mode and all songs. Wonderful transitions, like Jimi Hendrix [Castles Made of Sand](http://www.daily-lyrics-4all.com/Castles_Made_of_Sand_Lyrics.html) to [Tim & We We Ca](http://timsameke.calabashmusic.com/) doing Hazo Ri Lagoureme. Makes even the dullest PageMaker session bearable. And that's just the most noticeable fabby segue so far today.
