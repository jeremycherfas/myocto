... but if you're looking for some cutting-edge, ground-breaking, genre-bending, challenging music, keep away from these two:

Los Super Seven's _Heard it on the X_ is just rollicking good border music. Too short, which indicates how used I've become to bloated CDs. time was I would have been more than happy with a 37 minutes LP.

John Prine's _Fair and Square_ is fine folkish stuff but with his usual witty lyrics and some wonderful squeezebox and harmony.

I realize neither counts as an off the wall recommendation, but some of the time I need to be very definitely on the wall. Fact is, last week's shipment, which brought these and _ChÃ vez Ravine_, is perhaps the most successful threesome I've ever had the pleasure of purchasing.
