Sex, natural history, and speech-writing; disparate activities (is natural history an activity?) linked by the absurd expectations that art creates.

How much performance anxiety is engendered by pornography? You know its only a story, and yet ...

Who would sit still and watch while a pride of lions sleeps 23 hours of 24, having seen all those fine action sequences condensed into a single stunning TV show?

But the speech-writing is the worst. I watch The West Wing, a liberal's wet dream if ever there was one, and I know it is fiction. I know that there are several writers making people sound smart, and that the smart people are only acting. But wouldn't it be wonderful if life were like that?
