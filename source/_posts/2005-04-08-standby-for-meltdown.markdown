We've got a half holiday from work today, so I plan to use the time I would otherwise be on the train to upgrade WordPress. Here's hoping nothing goes too badly wrong.

Wow! So that was pretty straightforward. But now I need to get it looking how it was.

And that worked too -- with a couple of glitches. an unfortunate coincidence meant that I thought there was a problem here, but I think it was something wrong with my ISP. Secondly, the latest photo plug-in is not working. I don't know why, but I'm going to try and find out.
