> The point of this post is to simply provide my TextExpander snippets when using link posts via Google Chrome. These snippets were blatantly stolen from Jonathan Poritsky’s post above and modified to work with Chrome.

And therefor, what better page to test it on?

I’m slowly getting more familiar with Octopress, and thus more likely to use it. Still not sure exactly what this whole “external URI” thing is all about. From the docs, it seems like the title will link to the post I am commenting in. But then what about the permalink? Not that anyone is likely to need it. The [documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/linklog/) says that “each post will show it’s own permalink, and in the feed there will be a permalink at the end of linklog posts”. I need to see for myself what that actually looks like.

The other thing I need to do is think seriously about somehow making all this available on my travelling machine as well as here on my desktop. I’m away next week, and might just have time and something to say. I think I can do all that by moving the whole Octopress folder to Dropbox, but I guess I’d still need to equip the laptop with all the other stuff that makes Octopress work, and I’m not sure I’m going to be able to find time over the weekend.

p.s. Having generated and deployed this post, it doesn't seem to work as advertised; I need to try and figure out why.
