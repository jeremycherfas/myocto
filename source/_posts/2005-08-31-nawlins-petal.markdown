Never been there. But posts like [this](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/30/Nawlins) make me wish I had.

The Human Flower Project links to an impressive-sounding attempt to gather what we professionals call TK, or sometimes [IK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_knowledge), on the flowers of India. Rather than simply copy her links here, I suggest you [visit Julie's site](http://www.humanflowerproject.com/index.php/weblog/get_back_flowers_of_india/) and jump off from there.
