No idea whether this is going to work: probably not, as I don't think it will look very good. But the basic idea is to use Flickr for sets of photographs, albums if you will, with links from here, and my photoblog for individual postings. Sometimes those postings will be photos from Flickr sets, sometimes not.

It is a bit of a cumbersome soluiton, but I think it will work because although it uses three separate applications, each of those is good at the job it does and is not being press-ganged into doing something it doesn't want to.
