Start: 95.4 Last week: 88.7 This week: 89.1
**Tuesday 22 May: **The minor blitz didn't last all that long. Who wants to eat miso soup al desko when friends beckon with salads and the like? Daily weighing has made me very sensitive to the saltiness of the previous day's food. Obviously, the saltier my food, the wetter my body. But I've been wondering whether overall one would weigh less in the morning after really re-hydrating before going to bed. If I wake at any point in the night with a dry mouth and parched throat, I probably didn't drink enough. But aside from the inconvenience of having to get up to pee, would I actually excrete more over the course of the night?
