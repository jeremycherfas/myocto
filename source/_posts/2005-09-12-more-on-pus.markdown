Just read [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/). And weep. Because even if you don't think it is true, I know that it is.

I used to think, fresh-faced youth that I was, that if you just took the time to explain things to the public, they would make the "right" decisions. I've long since abandoned that view. Ben Goldacre explains the unequal struggle. What he does not explain is why any of us (them?) continue. 

Let's get this straight. Science is difficult. It is not about "facts". It needs work. And your life depends on it. You can choose to ignore it, or you can choose to let others ignore it on your behalf, or you can choose to try and understand at least some of it. But it won't be easy.
