![4932890 5B933A5425 T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/4932890-5b933a5425-t.jpg) On Flickr, as elsewhere, there are specialists. I've come to recognize a few who specialize in numbers, and in my hairshirt search for illustrations for this series I have sometimes chosen a lesser image rather than take yet another from one of them. But specialization often increases ability, and there's a fine line to be drawn between the fresh approach of a non-specialist and the guaranteed good, but possibly not superb, offerings of a non-specialist. There's a lesson there for all walks of life, I believe, to which I definitely need to pay more attention.
