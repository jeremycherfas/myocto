![80420065 A52338F8Cd T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/80420065-a52338f8cd-t.jpg) It was a brief tussle. The sinister little red guy said, "Fake it." The putti on duty [^fn1] chorused "Who would you be fooling?" And the putti won.

Two unforeseen social engagements yesterday conspired to deliver much merriment but no time to write. Hence the brief tussle. I could have faked it, and while I didn't make up the rules there's no actual punishment for breaking them. So I'm going with truth, at least this time. And a new rule. If I truly cannot, as opposed to will not, I don't have to.
