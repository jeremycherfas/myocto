Long ago -- and I really can't say when or where -- I remember reading about a bank that had supposedly written the following letter to a woman (I remember it was a woman; I could easily be wrong) who had been running a large and unauthorized overdraft:

> 
  
> 
> Dear Madam,
> 
> 

  
> 
> Could we please return to our former arrangement, whereby you banked money with us?
> 
> 

  
> 
> Yours etc.
> 
> 

I am reminded of this today by a letter quoted by [Andrew Tobias](http://www.andrewtobias.com/cgi-local/display_col.pl?090305), this time from a customer to his bank:

> 
  
> 
> Dear Sirs:
> 
> 

  
> 
> One of my checks was returned marked "insufficient funds." Does that refer to me or you?
> 
> 

Neat-o.
