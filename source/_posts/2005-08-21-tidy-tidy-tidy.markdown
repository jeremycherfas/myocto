A dull but ultimately satisfying day, unpacking and shelving six boxes of books that have been waiting since the end of June. And then tidying up some scans of slides from Canada. Much, much duller. Waiting for my machine to deal with a 70Mb file is worse by far than watching paint dry, and makes a mockery of using Preview in Photoshop to judge by eye the impact of any fiddling. Still, the job's done, and there's a [new set](http://flickr.com/photos/73529121@N00/sets/793086/) on Flickr to prove it. (More will have to wait.)

Flickr is impressive, no doubt, but there's one thing that annoys the hell out of me: re-ordering. You have to upload in reverse chronological order if you want the Photostream to appear in the correct order. And re-ordering the images in a set is a right pain, dragging each one but having to stay within the confines of the silly little scrolling window. I realize why it is hard -- because the image is given its unique Flickr number as it is uploaded -- but how hard would it be to enable decent control over the order of photos in the Photostream?
