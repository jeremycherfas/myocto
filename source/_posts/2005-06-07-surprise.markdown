The always excellent [Whiskey Bar](http://billmon.org/archives/) sends me scurrying to [Human Events](http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=7591) online, where I am saddened to learn that _The Origin of Species_ does not make the list of Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and  20th Centuries. Shame on the 15 conservative scholars (oxymoron, anyone?) and public policy leaders who compiled it.

Can anyone [smell something fishy](http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=623802005)? Customs officers "were alerted after hearing a 'flipping' sound coming from her skirt".

And [Dick Shagwell](http://dickshagwell.com/index.php)'s back in town.

Can the day get any better?

Later ... I can't believe it. The day did get better. [Dinosaurs vs Noah! ](http://www.livejournal.com/users/theferrett/519211.html)Perfection.
