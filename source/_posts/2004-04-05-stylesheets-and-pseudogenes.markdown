I had noticed, in developing the soon-to-be-released photoblog, that my stylesheets had got rather out of hand. There were, for example, several tags that had a value of 0px. It is so easy to do stylesheets in a suck-it-and-see kind of way by sticking a quick border around a division to visualize it on-screen, or adding a swift wash of background-color. Then, when everything is fine, rather than remove the border completely, I just set it to 0px. Or a whole Div that once seemed vital no longer serves any purpose. And over the aeons of internet time, debris like that accumulates; the pseudogenes of the stylesheet.

Being in the happy position of ruling this tiny bit of the cyber-universe like an Intelligent Designer ([ha!](http://www.talkdesign.org/)) this past weekend I resolved to do a bit of a clean-up. I think everything works better now. It certainly looks that way on the browsers I can use. But IE Win remains a mystery, not least because the network at work is down. Again.
