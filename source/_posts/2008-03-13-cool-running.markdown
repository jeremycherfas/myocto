![5996001 A7Ee11Caaa T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/5996001-a7ee11caaa-t.jpg) The first time it happened I was unprepared. We were out walking early, me and the dog, when she came up behind us silent as a submarine. Then she was past, veil flapping softly. Not dressed athletically. Aside from the veil [^fn1], the regulation dark anorak, blue skirt, black socks, black tights. (They couldn't possibly be stockings, could they?) And some sisters coming on behind, a couple less athletic than the others. Late for some specific prayer? _Mens sana in corpore sano_? There was no way to tell. Or maybe there was. I made it a bit of a mission.

[^fn1]: This bit doesn't count, but there'll be more on this topic in future.
