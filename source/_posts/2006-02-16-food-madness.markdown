A speaker at a meeting I was at this morning, about agricultural biodiversity and nutrition, said that fortified sugar was now on the market. There was a knowing chuckle from some in the audience, which nicely hid my gobsmacked ignorance. First chance I got, I checked. And blow me if it isn't true: [white sugar laced with iron and vitamin A](http://www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/htm/fortisugar.htm).

> With the present nutritional status of Filipinos being deficient in micronutrients like iron and vitamin A, the market for products like double-fortified sugar is very lucrative in Institutional and commercial levels.

Yeah, right. I suppose leafy vegetables and orange fruits (mango anyone? papaya?) just aren't modern enough. Or lucrative enough.
