Very odd to see a film as quintessentially English as [The History Boys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464049/) among an American audience. Were others aware of the crucial layering of "other" universities? Neither Hull nor Loughborough is Oxbridge, of course; but nor is Hull Loughborough. Excellent, excellent fun, and well portrayed too. All of the adults were both individuals and stereotypes, easily identifiable with my own teachers. The big difference from my own, oh-so-happy schooldays, was the sex. Of course we boasted of matters heterosexual. But I don't recall anything like the openness and acceptance of homosexuality shown by the history boys. [rating:4/5]
