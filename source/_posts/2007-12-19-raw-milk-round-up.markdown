One hears so much baloney from both sides in the great raw milk debate that it is as refreshing as an ice-cold glass of the white stuff to come across a balanced, non-strident examination of the claims. Inkling has just such a post: [Raw milk ... clean and healthy?](http://www.inklingmagazine.com/articles/raw-milkclean-and-healthy/). I'm looking forward to part two.
