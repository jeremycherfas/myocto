## Plains of old Nebrasky-o

![FW05303.jpg](/uploads/2009/11/FW05303.jpg) Program 8 _Broadsides_ in the [Sounds to Grow On](http://www.folkways.si.edu/explore_folkways/sounds_to_grow_on.aspx) series contained some wonderful songs, and some terrible ones (Song for Patty, anyone?). Some early Bob Dylan, some early Bob Dylan wannabees, some glorious others. But how could I resist a song that starts 
    
    In school I learned of men who died by the gun
    But not of those who died by the hoe
    The land has drunk the rains
    Of many a farmers blood
    Now forgotten and buried long a go
    

and continues in similar vein?

So, here we are. [The Plains of old Nebrasky-o](/uploads/2009/11/Plains-of-old-Nebraskyo.mp3), sung by Eric Chapman with Phil Ochs, from the Folkways album [Broadside Ballads volume 3](http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=969). (Bonus tip: for a real chill, listen to Phil Ochs do Links on the Chain.)
