Oh my! Someone called Erin has come out and said it: [I love dorks!](http://erindowney.blogspot.com/2006/07/i-love-dorks.html) This has partially manifested itself in a "total girl-hard-on" for PZ over at [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/), who is not that modest that he didn't note it. As it happens I am not in the market, but if I were, I'd try to impress her with how much random stuff I know. Go on Erin, ask me anything.

And if PZ thought that one woman love-bombing him was enough to make him blush, wait till he discovers that [news@Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/full/442009a.html) has done a little survey and found he has the highest ranked science blog of all, 179th according to Technorati. (I feel so cheap reading it; so many others have been there too.)

Later ... odd. I could have sworn the embargo said 1800 hrs London time. Yet here we are at 19.15 CEST and there's nothing at all over on Nature news.


Later still ... there it is, and I-ve fixed the link.
