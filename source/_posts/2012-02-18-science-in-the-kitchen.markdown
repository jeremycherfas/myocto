Spent this morning in the kitchen, doing three things.

A new batch of [peanut butter cookies](http://jeremycherfas.net/2011/04/18/reverse-engineering-a-loaf/). 

  * _Hypothesis_: They'll be as good or better, made with peanuts finely chopped in my fine chopper instead of peanuts.

  * _Method_: Follow recipe, but substitute 265 gm finely chopped salted peanuts for 265 gm peanut butter.

  * _Results_: They are as good, or better.

  * _Methodological flaws_: Judgement based on memory rather than simultaneous double-blind assessment.

  * _However_: Two relatively independent judges concur fully.

Two starters and but a single loaf.

  * _Hypothesis_: There's no difference between my [home-made ??-year-old sourdough starter](http://jeremycherfas.net/2007/11/28/practical-microbiology-101/) and the [Tuscan centenarian](http://jeremycherfas.net/2009/09/15/food-news-new-series-6-stories-to-savour/) I was entrusted with some time ago.

  * _Method_ (for 1st experiment): Use identical amounts of each starter to bake the standard loaf as suggested by the suppliers of the Tuscan pasta madre. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: You can guess what the 2nd experiment might be. 

  * _Results_: The two _bigas_ (or should that be _bige_?) look and smell identical. More tomorrow.

  * _Methodological flaws_: The Tuscan starters begins life stiffer (75%) than my own (100%), and this time contained a couple of flax seeds left over from the last bake.

  * _However_: Get real.

Fermented cabbage can repeat.

  * _Hypothesis_: Last month's sauerkraut was not a one-hit wonder. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: Too busy to blog it, but boy it was good. 

  * _Method_: Do it again.

  * _Results_: For now, the jar is packed. Come back in about three weeks.

  * _Methodological flaws_: This time I added caraway seeds and peppercorns, and I left out the red cabbage. I also severely misjudged the amount of cabbage needed, so the jar is only half full.

  * _However_: Maybe none of that will matter.
