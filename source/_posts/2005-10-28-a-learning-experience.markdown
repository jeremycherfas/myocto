A fine evening, as a Philistine among the anointed. My first exposure to the term "appropriation art" though not, I subsequently discovered, to appropriation art itself. Some of it I think I understand, the visual equivalent of musical sampling. Some I definitely don't, the [artistic equivalent of straightforward theft](http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid=2753&page=1)*. As ever, the web leaves me better informed, but no wiser. I give you:

  * [An Establishment's View](http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=23)
  * [An Artist's View](http://www.othercinema.com/otherzine/otherzine6/prelinger.html)
  * [ A Lawyer's View](http://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu/conf1999/landes.html)
Maybe you can make more sense of it than I can.

But the high point of the evening was most definitely wandering into the bathroom at the trattoria where we ended up for supper, and seeing a sign that read "Uomini Man". For one, brief moment I thought I was in some sort of hipster paradise. But no, that's where I had been earlier in the evening.

* There's a delicious irony in this particular link: "Sorry... image not available, due to copyright restrictions". Perfect, simply perfect.
