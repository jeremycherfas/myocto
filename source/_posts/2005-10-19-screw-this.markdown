I'm being deluged with comment spam. OK, so it isn't showing up on the site, thanks to WP's excellent filtering. But it is annoying. And hardly anyone ever sends a genuine comment. So I've blocked commenting for now. I'll restore it in a while and see whether the shitstorm has died down. If you're desperate to comment, and you're not some scum-fuelled spambot, you'll know how to email me.  I'm not even sure what's going on, though I believe it is is Something Nasty.
