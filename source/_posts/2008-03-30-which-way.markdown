![1472536055 0Cabe6Cc96 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/1472536055-0cabe6cc96-m.jpg) "We'll be leaving in a moment. Especially if you can tell me the route."
I thought the bus driver was joking, an attempt to break the ice with his sole passenger early on Sunday morning. But no. He hesitated at a crossroads.

"Turn left," I yelled.

More people were getting on, and when he attempted to go straight through the lights there was a general outcry. And the car behind wouldn't reverse. A woman took up the challenge of keeping the driver on the straight and narrow. Where else would a bus driver rely on passengers to know the route.
