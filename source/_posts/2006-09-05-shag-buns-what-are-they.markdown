Blue Girl In a Red State had me in a bit of a lather with a post about how she could avoid shopping if she gave (or didn't give; it wasn't at all clear to begin with) her hubby [Shag Buns](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2006/09/shag_buns_or_ho.html). Being a squeeky clean sorta gal from somewhere or other, she had no idea that the juxtaposition of "shag" and "buns" would, to a Brit who also speaks a bit of 'Murcan, immediately suggest certain activities involving hot dogs. I wasn't the first to say so in the comments, but this thing has got out of hand. Now Blue Girl is angling for [Shag Buns: The Movie](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2006/09/shag_buns_the_m.html#comments), or at the very least Shag Buns the small independent video that might be picked up by Colbert and made fun of.

I did point out to Blue Girl that I still had the most Googlejuice for my fine post on "[funny thing with mens privets spinning](http://www.google.com/search?q=mens%20privets%20spinning&sourceid=mozilla2&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)". Now we all have to help her stay on top of her Shag Buns.

Uh oh. I see that there's a hardcore search site sucking up my words at No. 2. Nothing I can do about that. But at No. 3 is something altogether weirder that I may need to try and do something about.
