There's a new link over in my left hand menu: [Online Poker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker) [?](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/archives/2005/02/19/bloggers-of-the-world-unite/).

Have I gone mad? No. This is a really neat idea from [Planet Ozh](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/archives/2005/02/19/bloggers-of-the-world-unite/) that might, if enough bloggers do it, result in the Wikipedia's entry for Online Poker being the top-ranked page for all searches for Online Poker.

What would be nice -- and alas I don't have the skill to do this -- would be for someone to start graphing the Wikipedia page's ranking to see whether this effort really does have an impact.
