After considerable soul-searching and head scratching I decided to switch away from [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/) for publishing my whole blog and move to something a little more focussed. So here I am on WordPress, impressed. I may well continue to use write and publish, but will definitely not be maintaining the static pages that I was generating before. Lots of things to do, as ever when playing with a new toy.


	
  * Import some -- or all ? -- old posts from Tinderbox

	
  * Work on the layout and stylesheets

	
  * Think about links

	
  * Work on an image gallery

That'll do to be getting on with.
