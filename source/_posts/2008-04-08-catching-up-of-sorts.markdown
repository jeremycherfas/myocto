I was idly trawling some statistics on my site when I noticed that someone had recently come looking for the "[scrotal safety commission](http://jeremycherfas.net/2004/11/12/scrotal-safety-commission/)". I vaguely remembered writing about that, but no more. So I clicked my own link, and the site now seems to be up for grabs, offering Russian Brides, Russian Women and Colon Cleansing. I'm not sure what to make of that. Seems they had a logo, once, [^fn1] and even a [LiveJournal community](http://community.livejournal.com/sscommission/profile?mode=full). Judging from other blog entries, they seem to have been promoting a caring, sharing attitude to scrotal safety. But I cannot for the life of me discover why anyone would let such a valuable property go. (The instigator is still journaling; maybe he'll see this and tell me.)

That same post also linked to [Afri-cola](http://www.afri.de/), a German drink. That site is still there, although not the advertising archive. The site is altogether too Flash, though, and I can't seem to find a blasted thing there. Someone tell me what it is all about. Please?
