You can't keep up with everything. Never has the truth of this maxim been brought home to me more forcefully than this morning, when a colleague love-bombed the entire staff with a link to [The case of the disappearing teaspoons: longitudinal cohort study of the displacement of teaspoons in an Australian research institute](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1498), a paper published as a non-denominational mid-winter gift in the British Medical Journal on 24 December 2005. This sort of stuff used to be meat and drink (and a monthly salary) to me, back in the day. Yet I knew nothing about this particular example of this sort of stuff. All I can do now is commend it to you wholeheartedly.
