I can't actually play with Google Earth myself, but I can appreciate what others are doing. Like the [ant map](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2005/10/the_ants_go_mar_1.html), which earned Google its very own ant: _Proceratium google_.

p.s. [Neddie](http://byneddiejingo.blogspot.com/2005/10/america-eats-its-young.html).

p.p.s. And [ftrain](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/in_the_city/i_am_gary_benchley.php). What a cool story.

p.p.s.

Go get 'em, [Freaks](http://www.freakonomics.com/2005/10/oh-crap.html).
