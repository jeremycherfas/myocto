"[Genetically modified foods are as safe as the conventional ones,](http://allafrica.com/stories/200409210049.html) but require more testing on long-term safety and the effects on the environment, a UN official has said in Nairobi." I've lost the plot here. If they as safe, why do they require more testing? And GM pollen has [set a new world record](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3675706.stm), a feat impossile to measure without GM.
