![625616214 D23D31B126 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/625616214-d23d31b126-m1.jpg) We'd been having some issues with technology. Things going too slow, too many options. If you've switched to GMail precisely because you don't always have access to Mail, why does iPhoto (curse it) insist on sending emails via Mail? Intertubes to the rescue, with instructions that will persuade iPhoto to send via GMail and, better yet, a [dinky little plug-in](http://iphoto2gmail.notoptimal.net/) that allows iPhoto to send directly from GMail. Interesting choices. Mail is more familiar. Plug-in is neater, but requires more effort at first. She's happy, I think, but I wonder which she will choose?
