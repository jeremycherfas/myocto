There's trouble at my blog. Used to be, you could go to jeremycherfas.net/wp or wp.jeremycherfas.net and end up at the same place -- here. But some time back -- don't know when, don't know where -- the second option stopped working. I tinkered, but couldn't seem to fix it. So now the home address is jeremycherfas.net ... but jeremycherfas.net/wp no longer works properly.

Aaaarrrrgh!!!!

I know just enough to break things a bit. Anyway, I've got feelers out for possible solutions, and my karma is good, so I'm hopeful. But if you have a bookmark, change it, please.
