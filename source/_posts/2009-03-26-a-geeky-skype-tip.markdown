Stupid, I know, to resume blogging with a nerdy Skype tip, but this is handy. I wanted to print a chat, [^fn1] but couldn't find a way to do so. Then I read at the Skype forum that you just type /htmlhistory where you would normally type text into the chat, and it opens the chat in a Browser window. from there it is easy to print the whole thing or cut and paste just the bits you need into a text document.

There are probably loads of other similar tweaks, but I don't currently need them.

[^fn1]: Yeah, yeah, paperless office, yada yada yada.
