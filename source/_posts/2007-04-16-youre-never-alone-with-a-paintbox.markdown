The alone-in-a-crowd bit doesn't work for The Squeeze if there are local children around. They are too curious and she is too generous and the end result is expensive water colours being daubed on expensive paper to the amusement of all concerned. Yesterday it was Mohamed and his pal Moustafa at the ouad in front of the Ait Ben Haddou kasbah. Today Moustafa and Hamid and a girl -- Zara -- by the Hotel la Gazelle in the gorges du DadÃ¨s.
