James Boyle, a law professor  at Duke University, has an entertaining and useful [comment](http://news.ft.com/cms/s/39b697dc-b25e-11d9-bcc6-00000e2511c8.html) on intellectual property rights (a subject really close to my heart) in the Financial Times.

> The closed-mindedness is remarkable. "That man eats only a little salad and looks slim. Clearly to look as good as him, we have to eat twice as much, and doughnuts too!"

Fine words.

Oh, and those very helpful [people](http://www.transycan.net/wp/) over at [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) Support have fixed my comment problem. So go ahead, comment already.
