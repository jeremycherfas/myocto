A good cappuccino is a good thing. Being able to get one at almost every bar is just one of life's little pleasantries round here. But there are those who have to live in a place where there just aren't five bars on every block, and for them, and the rest of us who just occasionally want a cappuccino in the privacy of our own homes, has sprung up an Edison of inventions. I've tried most of them, from battery operated whisk to plumber-inspired plunger. Heck, I once even owen a Krups machine that claimed to make frothy milk; they should have stuck to their guns. All have been unsatisfactory. (But in truth none was as bad as the 'Instant cappuccino" a desperate wife I know once tried. "Greasy sludge" was I think how she described it.)

Now, into my life, as a birthday present, has come the [Mukka Express](http://www.decuisine.co.uk/cookshop/tea_coffee_chocolate/mukka-express.html), completely with cutesy name, kitsch design (well, it lives in the kitschen), and impeccable pedigree; these are the people who created the original stove-top espresso pot. And the astonishing thing is, it works. Kind of. That is, it produces the closest thing to an authentic cappuccino I've yet had in a home. The foam lacks a little body, but that may be because I use partially-skimmed milk. Other than that, full marks.
It's a complicated little beastie, with a valve thing that sits on top of the spout where the coffee normally geysers forth. You put water in the bottom and coffee in the middle, just like a normal mokka pot, and you put milk in the top. It sits on the stove-top doing nothing as it builds up a head of steam, and then there's a satisfying, and slightly scary, click as the valve opens. Steam screams through the milk and when the noise dies down there's a cappuccino in the top.

All in all, well worth the faff.
