[Colleen](http://www.communicatrix.com/2010/05/frrrrriday-rrrrroundup-9.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Communicatrix+%28communicatrix%29) spotted this great flickr set of [new logos for BP](http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenpeaceuk/sets/72157623796911855/). Personally, I think the company will bounce back. After it all, it was only BP's calamity that brought the Exxon Valdez back into the news, and all of us who swore we'd never buy Esso again slowly forgot our pledges. Kinda stupid putting all rights reserved on the flagship image for the set though.
