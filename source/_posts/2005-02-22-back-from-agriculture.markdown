A fascinating article in [PLoS Biology](http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030071) talks about the origin of the Mlabri, "an enigmatic hunter-gatherer group from northern Thailand". These people have no diversity in their mitochondrial DNA and very reduced diversity elsewhere in their genomes. The evidence points to a recent origin, perhaps 500 to 800 years ago, from a group that was previously agricultural. Thus it seems that the road from hunter-gatherer to farmer is not always one-way.
