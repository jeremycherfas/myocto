Today's Lazarus (The only such award I have ever bestowed) goes to Antipixel, an image blog that I've been following for about 5 years, and that hasn't posted since 3 September 2006. [And now it's back](http://www.antipixel.com/blog/archives/2010/05/12/let_us_see.html). [^fn1]
[^fn1]: God bless RSS feeds. 

 Welcome.
