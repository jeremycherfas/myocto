I read this piece in the [New York Times, about the desirability of using weights, not volumes](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/dining/tipping-the-balance-for-kitchen-scales.html?_r=1&ref=dining)Â to measure ingredients when it first came out a month ago. And naturally ignored it; I mean, who needs to be told that? But today, when I went to print it out for some people who might need to be told just that, I discovered this perfect, perfect illustration of just why you should use weights, not volumes.

The De Gustibus column on Sept. 14, about using scales to weigh recipe ingredients, misstated the weight of a cup of sugar. It is about 200 grams, not 225 grams.
