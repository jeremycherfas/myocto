Adding to my list of Good Reasons to Live in Vancouver: the new [Greenheart Canopy Walkway at UBC Botanical Garden](http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/potd/2008/08/greenheart_canopy_walkway_at_ubc_botanical_garden.php). [^fn1]

Adding to my list of Good Things that Come from Canada: [CBC Radio 2 Concerts on Demand](http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/cod/).

[^fn1]: Must be something in the air. [Kew has one too](http://apps.kew.org/trees/). Kew's web site looks good. But UBC's walkway looks better. _[Via](http://www.catchingtherain.com/)_.
