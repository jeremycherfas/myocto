He's a caution, that Silvio Berlusconi! That thing about [no-sex](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2006/01/31/dont-make-promises-you-cant-keep/), because I've got an election? [All a joke](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/WeirdNews/2006/01/31/1420325-ap.html).

Of course, as was said in [another (sex-fuelled) context](http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1247452), he would say that, wouldn't he. Or, for those who prefer an ETLA, [MRDA](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2005/06/20/linux_is_terrible_says_openbsd_man.html).

And I still think that, even as a joke, it reveals a pretty misogynistic view of the world.
