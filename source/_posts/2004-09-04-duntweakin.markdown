Rather a good day, I think, going through the CSS and making sure that all font sizes are relative. Of course, not having access to IE/Win I can't actually check that it looks OK in the Great Satan's browser. and I can't remember the address of that website that takes a snapshot of a page in any browser. But I'm happy enough with the way it looks, for now.
