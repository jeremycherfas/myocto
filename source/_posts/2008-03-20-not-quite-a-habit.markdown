![266259713 9D9D7B49B2 T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/266259713-9d9d7b49b2-t.jpg) [Blue Girl asks](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/03/17/a-real-mistress-of-the-art/#comment-9451): "Have you created your new habit yet?" And the truth is, "No, not quite". I was very tempted to skip today; late, tired, I could always backdate it tomorrow morning.  A real habit would not have allowed that. And to be honest, if I hadn't taken the precaution of preloading a few entries with their numbers (my hair shirt is scratchier than yours, as I told Blue Girl elsewhere), I know I would have skipped. Would it be cheating to line up, say, one post for emergency use? Probably not, and I will explain why tomorrow.
