![2179047732 0D2843Bebb M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2179047732-0d2843bebb-m.jpg) Little and often has such appeal. Write 500 words a day and you'll have a decent sized book, with revisions, in under a year. With weekends off. Scan 10 slides an evening and before you know it those giant boxes of unsorted images are sitting up on Flickr just itching to be ignored. But life gets in the way. Always. Miss just one day and you're done for. This time it is going to be different, not least because I refuse to announce my intentions. [Blue Girl knows](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2008/03/no-time-like-th.html). And maybe [OOC](http://oocradio.blogspot.com/2008/01/50-100-50-challenge-post-1-of-50.html), whose friend is a contraction. Not me.
