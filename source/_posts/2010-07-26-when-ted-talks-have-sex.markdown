Odd things sometimes happen when the train is a little late and you get to hear two Ted talks  back to back, in the order you downloaded them. You get to see [Carl Safina](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/carl_safina_the_oil_spill_s_unseen_culprits_victims.html) identifying the real reasons for "accidental" oil spills: corporations that have bought government out from under us. And you get to see [Matt Ridley](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html) saying that the average person has gained 7.5 seconds in leisure time since 1950, in the amount they have to work to obtain an hour of light, and that this represents progress.

And that can ruin at least the start of your day.
