I'm pretty certain about this one, but not absolutely. Lots of beaches, lots of walks, surely on one of them the moon was shining. Maybe the time I watched turtles coming ashore to nest? Or the penguins doing their regular-as-clockwork parade at [Phillips Island](http://www.penguins.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9&Itemid=54&mytabsmenu=1). Not a huge amount of walking, but still. And definitely on the beach in Baja California, passing the campfire when the mate euphemistically called out, "Wanna go for a walk?" and we replied, all straight-arrow and upright, "No thanks, we've just had one". And we had. Euphemistically speaking. I'm sure I remember moonlight.
