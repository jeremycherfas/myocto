Managed to get to see the Al Gore movie, which really is very good indeed. Impressive mostly for the way he articulates the arguments, the words and presentation never merely mirroring one another -- except for when he actually wants them too. Getting on a lifting platform to show how far above baseline CO2 levels will be in a few years time under business as usual is one of the few gimmicks, and works all the better for that. The end titles are moving too, in the best sense, with their suggestions of concrete actions one can take. How easy would it be to offset my carbon emissions? Well, I know the answer to that: very. But how much would it cost? One to investigate. A bigger question: how easy would it be to offset the emissions of the place where I work? And who would pay?
