I was going to post a link to this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdt3zIrNrXs) of John Martyn at Cropredy when I heard the sad news, but the truth is, it doesn't do anyone justice.

So listen to the version [John Martyn did with Levon Helm](http://web.me.com/jcherfas/Site/Media/13%20Rock%20Salt%20%26%20Nails.mp3) instead.

And as an aside, why does [Bob Dylan's similarly-paced version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=qtKkYsw1sfk&fmt=18) [^fn1] sound merely plodding, while Martyn and Helm manage to make it sound, oh, I don't know, majestic?

[^fn1]: I'm not sure Levon was even there; he is certainly not much in evidence if he was. [He wasn't](http://theband.hiof.no/articles/the_ties_that_bind.html)
