Right now, I have to say that a day off would be a joy and a delight except for one teeny thing. The work would still be here when I got back. And the looming deadlines aren't planning to take any days off themselves, that I know.

Like a lot of things, this one depends on living with a clear distinction between work and not-work, and that's something that has never come easily to me. Until recently. But now, here I am, blogging during my lunch hour. If that isn't sick, what is?
