I know I've neglected this site lately, and I know that people who apologize for neglecting their sites are a pain in the butt. But ... I haven't been entirely idle elsewhere. There really does seem to be some set number of words in me each day, replenished each night, and if I spend them some place else, I'm skint by the time I get here. But I do come across things worth sharing; maybe I need one of them there social thingies that make it easier to share a quickie, but not [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/#!/jeremy.cherfas) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/nivavilov), because I'm already multiple personalities there. But I waffle. And waste words. So here is a lovely post from Aid Watch:

> [And now going for the Aid Watch record on global charity cluelessnessâ€¦](http://aidwatchers.com/2010/10/and-now-going-for-the-aid-watch-record-on-global-charity-cluelessness/)

Which I picked up on Twitter. And the posts it links to are pretty priceless too.
