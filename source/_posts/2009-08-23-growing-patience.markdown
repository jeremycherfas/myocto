One of the [Mandevilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandevilla) plants, which I [started from seed](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/04/14/promises-promises/), and rescued after [mishaps](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/08/23/nature-notes/) and neglect, has flowered.

Which, of course, is why I sowed it.
