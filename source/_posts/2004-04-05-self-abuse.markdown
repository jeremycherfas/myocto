There certainly is some strange stuff out there. [This](http://www.post-gazette.com/breaking/20040329pornp6.asp) can't possibly be a [hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax). Can it? If it is, it is just perfect. If it isn't, it somehow captures the spirit of the times better than the truth.

The first link is from [Centricle](http://centricle.com/). The second from [ftrain](http://www.ftrain.com/).

Now, about recycling links, it has often been said that the average blogger is shouting into an echo chamber. The justification that "my readers don't read the blogs I read" is lame. So one has to add something, I reckon. And that is what I plan to do in future.

It may be by going a click or two further than I'm sent. It may be by pulling together disparate posts. But it will, I hope, be more than a mere echo.
