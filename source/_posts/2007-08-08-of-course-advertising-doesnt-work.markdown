Kids prefer food [wrapped in Mac uniform](http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/diet.fitness/08/06/mcdonalds.preschoolers.ap/index.html) over the same food in [mufti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufti_%28dress%29). I'm kinda not surprised. Picked up at [Cleek](http://cleek.lunarpages.com/blogs/?p=1813), via Neddie's blogroll; thanks both.
