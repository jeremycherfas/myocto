![Cartoon](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/wp-content/121304_m.gif)
Blast! I can't find the cartoon from a December New Yorker, which in which a woman reminds a man. "Of course nobody reads your blog. It's about you." I need it for this post. No matter.

It is strangely addictive having a simple stats package like [SlimStat](http://wettone.com/code/slimstat) or [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/). Not just to see how many people might be there, but who they might be. So when I saw that something or someone from [edgeio](http://www.edgio.com/) had come calling, I wondered who they might be. Now I know, but I'm none the wiser.

There's certainly [a lot of excitement](http://technorati.com/tags/Edgeio) out there. [One blog](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/07/edgeio-launching-soon/), which seems to know, says "Edgeio will give you the ability to do new and (we think) really exciting things with your blog." [Another](http://www.lightbox5.com/movabletype/archives/2005/12/edgeio_teaser.html) is piqued by a teasing photo of the interface, which (unsurprisingly) gave me no clues. And that deliciously (or maliciously?) linked to a [typo](http://www.edgio.com/) of the actual [edgeio](http://www.edgeio.com/) site.

The best guess -- by Frank Gruber -- suggests it is a [competitor to GoogleBase](http://www.somewhatfrank.com/2005/11/what_is_edgeio.html). 

What's going on? I have no idea. But I'm sure it will be synergistic, empowering, enabling and non-fattening. and of course I signed up, to keep myself out there on the razor's edge.
