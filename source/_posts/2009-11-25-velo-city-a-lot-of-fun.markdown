That sounds like a whole lot of fun, in a Futurama kind of way. I'd be there, for sure. [Tom Turner says](http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/2009/11/23/commuter_cycling_tube_elevated/) a similar idea has been proposed for Toronto. Wonderful notion, [crap web site](http://www.velo-city.ca/MainFrameset.html). But then, they probably have other things to be getting on with.
