George Monbiot has an alarming piece about the ramifications of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which has just passed its third reading in the UK's House of Commons. Read [George](http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/02/22/protest-as-harassment-/) for the full story. I can only marvel that handing a leaflet to two people will soon constitute harassment, as will many other activities too trivial to have worried about before. Like sending polite emails to a company.
