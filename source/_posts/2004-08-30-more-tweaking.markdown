That wasn't actually too painful. I managed to migrate a lot of the old look over to WordPress without getting into too much trouble. There's lots still to be done, most of it painfully obvious, but for the moment I'm pretty happy.

Crucial stuff includes learning about child selectors, and those pesky links. Obviously the whole Headline section needs a decent makeover. And I'm not overjoyed with the calendar. The gap between the left hand menu and the main body is too small, compared to the gap on the right. And I ought probably to set a max-width for the main content.

Other than that?
