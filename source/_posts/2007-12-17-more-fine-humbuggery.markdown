> The War on Christmas folks object to the removal of Christ from Christmas.  (If you're going to be an etymological Feinschmecker, please note that _Jesus_ is  a name -- cf. _Jehoshua_, _Joshua_ -- while _Christ_ is a title or epithet.  Which is to say that if you're seriously into the Etymological Fallacy, then insisting on the title _Christ_, and words related to it, is insisting that other people recognize Jesus as "the anointed one", the Son of God and Our Lord.)
