I'm a guy. Well, I am; no point denying it. So I felt a furtive guilty pleasure reading the Communicatrix's [Notes to a Young Lady upon reaching her majority](http://www.communicatrix.com/2008/02/notes-to-a-young-lady-upon-reaching-her-majority.html). But I'm glad I did, because apart from the pap smears and similar stuff, every word she wrote is golden.
