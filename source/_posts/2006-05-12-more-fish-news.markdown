Scanning for other comments on [Neil Shubin's essay](http://jeremycherfas.net/2006/05/11/from-the-man-who-found-the-fish-with-wrists/) (which really is rather good) I landed on Martin Brazeau's blog [Lancelet](http://lancelet.blogspot.com/). It's good, one for the old feedreader. But what amused me most was the [letter he wrote](http://www.dispatch.com/editorials-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/05/07/20060507-B4-03.html) to The Columbus Dispatch, pointing out, rather good naturedly I thought, some of the flaws in the [IDiotic "rebuttal"](http://www.dispatch.com/editorials-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/04/29/20060429-A13-04.html) of Tiktaalik's status.

Which reminds me, I must get to grips with my own post about newspaper letters ...
