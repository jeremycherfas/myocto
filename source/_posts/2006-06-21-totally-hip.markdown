[Indietits](http://www.indietits.com/) is quite simply the best thing about logging on to my computer every morning. OK, so I don't get some of the more obscure musical references -- which are a bit yoof for me -- but the guy is completely on the money.

Also totally cool is Sadie Ryan over at [Blogsford](http://blogsford.blogspot.com/2006/06/farty-fish.html), with a set of three dynamite links on clupeid flatulence..
