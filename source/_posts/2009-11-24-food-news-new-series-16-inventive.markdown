_My grand scheme to end world hunger using modern technology seems to have fallen on stony ground. Fortunately I can still eat._


[![Necci06](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2772/4129293002_1c1dac465b_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/73529121@N00/4129293002) When I joined the secret confraternity of home bread bakers back in the summer, the restaurant Necci 1924 fed us a remarkable lunch to tide us over the rising of the bread. Among the items was the most delicious kind of savoury Chelsea bun, a spiral confection of soft bread, prosciutto, tomatoes and, maybe (though I don't remember) herbs like rosemary. I ate my fill, and lusted after more. But I didn't know what they were called. So I threw myself on the assembled wisdom of [The Fresh Loaf](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/14353/i-want-recipe-something-and-i-don039t-even-know-what-it-called), where Scott Hall emerged from the chaos with some recommendations.

So I did it, based on the recipe in Dan Lepard's Exceptional Breads but using my starter and only half quantities.


    
    150 gm white starter at 100% hydration
    390 ml warm water
    500 gm grano tenero 0
    10 gm salt
    1/2 tsp demerara sugar
    25 gm olive oil
    100 gm prosciutto
    100 gm sun-dried tomatoes
    


  1. In a large bowl, I mixed the water with the starter, then stirred in 250 gm of the flour. I covered the bowl and left that to get going, about 4 1/2 hours.

  2. Added 25 gm of olive oil (as per Scott's suggestion of 5% oil) then tipped in the remaining 250 gm of flour, the salt and the sugar. In the absence of the mixer Dan's reccipe calls for I did a stretch-and-fold every 10 minutes for an hour.

  3. I spread the dough out into a rough rectangle on a silicone mat and placed a layer of prosciutto on top, leaving about the bottom third clear along the long edge to seal it. Then striped the sun-dried tomatoes across the dough.

  4. Rolling to dough up wasn't as hard as I expected, using the silicone scraper carefully. I transferred it onto a floured wooden board and sealed the seam as best as I could. Then sliced it into 12 rounds, which I transferred to an oiled baking tray, leaving space between them to allow for expansion. Next time I might try packing them in a little closer, even at the risk of them joining together.

  5. Covered with a cloth and allowed to rise for about an hour, then into an oven at 220 â„ƒ for 25 minutes.

  6. On removing them from the oven I brushed them again with more olive oil, going over them three times in total.

You can see the [whole set of photos here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcherfas/sets/72157622739037649/show/). Were they as good as the ones at Necci? I don't honestly know. May have to go back there soon. Were they good? You bet; gently chewy with the flavour of the ham and some bites intense with salty tomato. Definitely best warm, and they reheat brilliantly in a dry skillet over a low flame with a lid on.

I'm sending this to [Yeastspotting](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/category/yeastspotting/), just in case anyone else wants to try it.
