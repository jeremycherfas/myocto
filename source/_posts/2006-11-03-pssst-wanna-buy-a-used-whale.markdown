Hurrah! The World Society for the Protection of Animals is soliciting bids to buy a whale from Iceland. Donate USD 10 [here](http://www.wspa-international.org/ebay) at eBay and WSPA will offer the money to the Icelandic government on condition that they spare the life of one fin whale (they've already killed five, apparently).

Never mind that AFP, which ran [the original story](http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Animal_Group_Bids_To_Buy_Whale_Life_From_Iceland_999.html), thinks that this is "a novel way of saving whales". Those of us with longer memories know that [this is not so](http://jeremycherfas.net/2006/06/28/sounds-familiar/). But we're not proud, or hungry for glory, or anything. We just want to see whalers and conservationists slug it out with sacks of nickels on a level playing field.
