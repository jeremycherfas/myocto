I don't mean to make light, but levity often stares back at the face of awfulness. [Blue Wren](http://wren-o-blue.blogspot.com/2006/08/that-niggly-question.html) reports:


> Recently, a National Public Radio reporter in Baghdad informed listeners that religious extremists murdered a shepherd because, well, he wouldn't diaper his goats to hide their naughty bits. And a grocer was killed because the stalks of celery in his market were too close to the tomatoes, lewdly suggesting â€“ the horror â€“ erect male genitalia.

Iraq is now in midst of civil war. They're killing each other because of immodest goats and indecent vegetables. Simplistic? Yes. True? Yes.

That cannot be correct, can it it? I know it isn't right.
