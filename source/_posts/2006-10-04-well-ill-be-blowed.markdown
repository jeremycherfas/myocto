That old joke about oral sex and lobster thermidor? Simply not funny any more. [Tim Harford explains](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c8a5e558-3339-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html) why giving head is now the _dish de jour_ among certain groups of teenage girls. It seems to have little to do with the reasons advanced by a slightly overwrought Caitlin Flanagan in [The Atlantic Monthly](http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=06/02/03/0241255&mode=nested&tid=18). Flanagan overwrote:


> The moms in my set are convinced â€” they're certain; they know for a fact â€” that all over the city, in the very best schools, in the nicest families, in the leafiest neighborhoods, twelve- and thirteen-year-old girls are performing oral sex on as many boys as they can. They're ducking into janitors' closets between classes to do it; they're doing it on school buses, and in bathrooms, libraries, and stairwells. They're making bar mitzvah presents of the act, and performing it at "train parties": boys lined up on one side of the room, girls working their way down the row.

But while she touched on a whole bunch of reasons that she thought behind the trend, Flanagan missed the one reason isolated by the economists whose work Harford reports: It's safer. (She also missed the fact that it might also be as much fun to give as to receive, but that's a whole 'nother [godbotherin' story](http://christdot.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8401).)

Astute clickers will discover that the link to The Atlantic Monthly is not, in fact, a link to The Atlantic Monthly (which charges for the privilege of reading back issues (as it were), but to [Inter Activist Information Exchange](http://info.interactivist.net/); let them worry about breaking copyright.
