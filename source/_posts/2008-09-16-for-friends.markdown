From [Federer as Religious Experience](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?ei=5090&en=716968175e36505e&ex=1313726400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all), by David Foster Wallace, which I would like to dedicate, posthumously, to DFW and my friend Dudley Doust.

P.S. Dept. of You-Couldn't-Make-It-Up: DFW gave us the Year of Depends Adult Undergarments. Now Dubai gives us the [Anything-you-want-with-any-name-you-want](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121814812246222217.html). Thanks, [Tom](http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/2008/09/how_much_for_the_bridge.html).
