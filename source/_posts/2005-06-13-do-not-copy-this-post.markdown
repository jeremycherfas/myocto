At a late dinner with new friends, and the talk turned to the internet, and search engines. In a trice, given that half the assembled company were teachers of one sort or another, we were on plagiarism, and how the internet both makes it easier to do and easier to detect. I raised the [Laura K. Krishna](%20http://www.aweekofkindness.com/blog/archives/articles/%20%0Athe_laura_k_krishna_saga/index.html) episode. (That archive, by the way, really ought to break the time-honoured blogger's rule of freshest content first; it's a story, and I for one prefer my stories to start at the beginning.)

Having heard the basic facts of the matter, one of our number said "Well, I'm not sure plagiarism is so bad. It depends on the circumstances." There was a collective intake of breath and a couple of vain attempts to pursue the matter. But no further explanation.

In a follow-up message, one of the diners, sent me an email that included this:

> One of my favorite lines from a student paper, about Donne's 'The Bait': 'At first this poem seems hard to understand, however after careful analization we can say that it is about fishing.'  No plagiarism there!

Fun stuff. But of course, I didn't know the poem. I looked it up. "Ah, [that one](http://plagiarist.com/poetry/2320/)!" And where did I look it up? [Plagiarist.com](http://plagiarist.com/poetry/).
