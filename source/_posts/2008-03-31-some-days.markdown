![2267071797 4E8629039F M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2267071797-4e8629039f-m.jpg) Some days, and I confess with pride that this is the first since I took my original tentative steps on this road to writing redemption, are so utterly bereft of publicly usable incident and inspiration that it fair boggles the imagination, looking back across the empty wasteland, to conceive of how it is that, forced to rely on mere reflex to drive the mechanism of the body, one emerges at the other end not only intact and with all senses functioning more or less at their customary level, but also, and this is the really unbelievable part, a dollar richer.
