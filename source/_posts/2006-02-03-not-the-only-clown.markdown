Seems Silvio Berlusconi isn't the only head of state who [likes a laugh](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2006/02/02/how-do-we-know/), though as far as I know he doesn't choose a State of the Republic address to clown around. From Neddie comes news that George W [Bush was only kidding](http://byneddiejingo.blogspot.com/2006/02/laugh-clown-laugh.html#comments) when he said that the US was going to reduce its dependence on Middle East oil. "His energy adviser and national economic adviser said Wednesday that the president didn't mean it literally."

Is there some other way to mean it?

And then there's news that the Energy Department in the US is [about to lay off researchers into renewables](http://susiemadrak.com/2006/02/02/14/29/ha-ha-just-kidding/).

Didn't Bush talk about kicking an addiction? And haven't we just had enough of some other joker's fictional additction-kicking? And shouldn't Oprah get a chance to grill George?
