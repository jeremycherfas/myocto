Two weeks ago, news of a weird search for "[free animal privets](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2006/02/23/what-the/)". Today, someone is on the hunt for "[sow girls privets](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Sow++Girls++Privets)" where I am proud to stand at No. 2.

Maybe its a Thursday thing?

I'm left wondering, of course, what this possibly dyslexic seeker is truly seeking. [Infundibulation](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=infundibulation&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)?

Later ... seems I'm not the only one. the prevert (_sic_) privet seeker was back again today, and in [that search](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=girls+privets&FORM=MSNH&srch_type=0), thanks to this post, I'm No. 1. But someone called Fred [enjoyed similar attention](http://www.fragmentsfromfloyd.com/fragments/2004/04/bushes.html) a couple of years ago.
