Relaxing in my headphones with the iPod on shuffle and my mind at 11,000 metres, I was jarred rudely awake. Ella and Louis had just finished singing A Foggy Day when what should Frank Sinatra choose to sing but the_ exact same song_. This is the first time this has ever happened to me in many, many shuffle sessions. Freaky, or what? I mean, what are the odds?

3751 to 1, as it happens.

Four songs later, blow me down and it happens again. No sooner has the Rolling Thunder Review done with Hard Rain than up pop Billy Mystic and the Mystic Revealers to do the dub version. Even freakier, no?

Without selecting the tracks in advance, I make that better than 14 million to 1.

Clearly I need to hit a casino tonight. Not.
