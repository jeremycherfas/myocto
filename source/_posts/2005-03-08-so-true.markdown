[43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/2005/03/rules_of_thumb_.html) has a posting about Rules of Thumb, a series of books containing, er, rules of thumb.

Like:

> Keeping Yourself in Shoes - If you switch back and forth among three pairs of shoes, they will last as long as five pairs of shoes worn out one pair at a time.


There's a plea for the books to be republished. I hope they are.
