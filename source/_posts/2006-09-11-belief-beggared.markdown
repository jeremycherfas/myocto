From the email alert of today's New York time:


> - QUOTATION OF THE DAY -

"If I didn't believe in God I wouldn't be here, I'd be in a mental home someplace."
- IRENE SMITH, of Brooklyn, whose firefighter son, Leon, died in the Sept.
11 attacks.

Of course, in a sane world, the reverse would be true. And I'm not going to labour the "my god's better than your god, so there" point either.
