"My" Ugandan chicken farmer has repaid 8% of the loan she got from [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=33024). That's not at all bad, given that the loan was disbursed less than a month ago. Of course, it would be nice to know a bit more about how Sylvia and the rest of her group are getting on, but they're probably way too busy earning a living to be bothered with niceties like news.
