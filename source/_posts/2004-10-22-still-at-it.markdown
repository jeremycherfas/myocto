One of the absurdities of modern life is that no matter where one is, one feels compelled to carry on as if one were back at home. I tell the email world I am Out of Office, only to feel duty bound to keep up with incoming emails. (Actually, this is self-preservation, since even though they know, after one email, that I am not there, people will insist on sending stuff anyway. But I digress.) So Luigi keeps sending links, which is great as I need some entertainment. And I feel I ought to share. So here goes.

How I'd like to be in Turin at the opening of [Terra Madre](http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=1216472004), a food fair organized by Slow Food.

What's the Latin for [spin doctor](http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1213412004)?

University of Delaware offers a spiffy set of [botanical illustrations](http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/hort/).

And then there's [this](http://www.galumpia.co.uk/adult/adult_2.htm#). I hesitated for a moment or three, but then plunged right on in. And laughed. A lot.
