A friend writes: nearly fell into my screen this a.m. when I read about the [100 pound (sterling) pizza](http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/food_and_drink/features/article318695.ece) . . . . conspicuous consumption???

That Gordon Ramsey! He's a caution. And he can take his truffles and his "wild mizuna lettuce leaf" which isn't a lettuce, almost certainly isn't wild, and is perhaps the easiest green in the world to grow, and stuff them up his calzone.

That prompts thoughts of a visit to Salvatore tonight on the way home, for a slice of the best pizza in the world, no ifs, no buts,  no  doubt about it. I'd tell you where it was, only then I'd have to kill you. I promised that much to the woman who told me and didn't kill me.
