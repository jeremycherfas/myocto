No, my headline has nothing to do with the story, really. But I'm tired. Which is why I link without comment to [Ben Goldacre's dissection](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2025623,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=11) of the recent "GM-potatoes cause cancer" flare-up. I've got something cooking myself, which will go nicely with one of the comments Ben elicited, but it needs to simmer a few more hours.
