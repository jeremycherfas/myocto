[![407029568_e2601c469e_m.jpg](/uploads/2008/12/407029568-e2601c469e-m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/siutung/407029568/) Well, duh! Many a time and oft. But this does raise the issue of parochiality on the interwebs. Many items on the original TID list would seem remarkable only to a Murcan, and despite the clearly global nature of the net many users thereof (and not only Murcans) seem to have no ability to use it to expand their boundaries or experiences.

But if I were to replace "Visited Paris" with something more remarkable for, say, a person from England, what would I put? Rome, Georgia? Athens, Texas? Paris, Tennessee? (Bonus points available.)

The web should make borders less obvious.
