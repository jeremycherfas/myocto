A Ken Loach comedy? For the first half hour or so that seemed unlikely in the extreme. Oh sure, there were laughs as the Voice of God tried to prevent a harmless drunk falling under a fast-approaching train. But as the beak sentenced the four stars to community service, and awful sudden violence rained down, I had my doubts. Quite suddenly, though, [The Angels' Share](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924394/) left gritty reality behind and crossed the border into comedy heist land, complete with kilt jokes, almost cock-up and nail-biter hearts-of-gold ending. Very entertaining. And seeing a VW camper trundling through the Trossachs with The Proclaimers at 11 took me back a few years, to trundling through the Trossachs with The Proclaimers on 11. Paul Brannigan -- Criminal Angel Mastermind -- gives an excellent performance, and is rumoured to have a part in [Sunshine on Leith](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2481198/), which also features music by The Proclaimers. That'll be one to watch out for too.
