> First one sheep jumped to its death. Then stunned Turkish shepherds, who had left the herd to graze while they had breakfast, watched as nearly 1,500 others followed, each leaping off the same cliff, Turkish media [reported](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/turkey_sheep_suicide;_ylt=A86.I2wrA9BCkVsB4Bas0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3ODdxdHBhBHNlYwM5NjQ-).

I think I know what happened. The sheep had learned that their favorite Disney scene, the one where the lemmings jumped over the cliff, had been [faked](http://www.disinfo.com/site/displayarticle974.html). And they decided that with so much mendacity in the world, there was no reason to live.
