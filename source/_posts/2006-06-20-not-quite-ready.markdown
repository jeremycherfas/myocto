[![Mog Error](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2006/06/mog_error-tm.jpg)](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/2006/06/mog_error.jpg)

I hurried off to Mog, ready to try some of that feel-good musical group hug it offers. I read the blurbs, which don't actually tell you all that much about what you are getting into, and decided, "what the heck, I'll register".

So my first two choices of screen names were taken. No biggie. I'll try a third. That was available. But now, it seems, I cannot register because my email has already been taken!

WTF? When did that happen? when I first submitted my registration? That seems, how can I put this delicately, unutterably dumb. And in case you can't be arsed actually to read the error message in my little snapshot, here it is in its entirety. 


> There was 1 error which prevented this form from being saved:

    * Email Address has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken has already been taken

Ah well, I guess I'll just keep my music to myself. And the world heaved a sigh of relief.
