[![6400426 79Adf2568C T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/6400426-79adf2568c-t-tm.jpg)](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/6400426-79adf2568c-t.jpg) While I continue to work on cultivating stick-to-it-ness, I want to share the Queen Of Them All: The Communicatrix. She developed this thang called the [21-Day Saluteâ„¢](http://www.communicatrix.com/21-day-salutes) in which she, er, takes a idea and writes 21 solid posts over, er, 21 days. Worries it to death, you might say. No way I could contemplate that. Not yet. But the truth is, while she's been jazzing up her site and hanging with the rest of the A-list over at SXSW the rest of the world is jonesing for another salute. So how about it?

_N.B. Those "ers" are words, right? I didn't just stick 'em in as makeweights. They're there for a purpose._
