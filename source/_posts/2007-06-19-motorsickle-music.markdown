This is for [Neddie](http://byneddiejingo.blogspot.com/2007/06/im-off-again.html), and [Blue Girl](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2007/06/i_like_smokin_l.html), and the [Viscount](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/2007/06/it-was-summer-of-68.html). Because there are known icons and unknown icons. And back in 1968, while The Viscount was being a biker, I wanted to be the bloke who could play guitar so well that the Art Master let him spend lunch-hours practising.

Red hair and black leather, my favourite colour scheme. Actually, I think I prefer this version.
