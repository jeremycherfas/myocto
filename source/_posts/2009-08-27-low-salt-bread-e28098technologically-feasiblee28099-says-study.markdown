> Formulating breads with one quarter of current levels is possible without detrimentally affecting the rheological properties and the performance of the dough, says a new study from Ireland. 


I expect [bakers throughout Tuscany](http://www.toscanainsolita.it/gastro/pgas2.php?epid=30&lang=eng) [^fn1] will be [thrilled to hear that](http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Publications/Food-Beverage-Nutrition/FoodNavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/Low-salt-bread-technologically-feasible-says-study/).

[^fn1]: Crappy link, but it'll do. Google [Tuscany Bread](http://www.google.it/search?q=tuscany+bread&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) for more.
