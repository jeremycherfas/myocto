> Readers of The Economist will know that there is some disagreement about the Shim Sham, from which Mr Reed developed the Shim Sham Shimmy. Some say it started as a tap routine in the early 1900s; others credit it to the Brains-as-well-as-Feet team.

They don't write obituaries like they used to. Thank God. And [this one](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=S%27%2988%25P1%5F%2B%21%40%21%24%0A&CFID=26976577&CFTOKEN=3d53310-f6bc2037-1840-4a4b-927b-eefd0abc0889) from The Economist is an absolute gem. Alas, I can't find an article I read some time ago about the rise of the modern obituary, although I recall that it was extremely fine.
