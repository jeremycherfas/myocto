Luigi -- who is presumably thinking a lot about career changes -- is taking pointers from a [most unusual source](http://omega.med.yale.edu/~pcy5/misc/overlord1.htm). No. 99 is particularly sweet, and will doubtless form the basis for a PhD thesis in the not too distant future.

And then there's this [spooky cartoon](http://chezpim.typepad.com/blogs/2005/03/so_was_it.html) from chez Pim, who blogs about food but gives us a taste of the future.

On images and metadata, Ongoing complained that Google couldn't find images based on metadata. [Now it can](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/04/04/Cherries-Won). But this is just the start. Google (and other search engines) really ought somehow to be able to search in embedded metadata that images can contain. Embedded metadata is the only way to really keep information on images, and the sooner it becomes fully searchable, the better.
