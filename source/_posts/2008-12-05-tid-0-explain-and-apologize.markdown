![402802775_1e7643816e_m.jpg](/uploads/2008/12/402802775-1e7643816e-m.jpg)Never explain, never apologize? Crap, fit only for posturing ninnies.If someone doesn't understand, you have failed to communicate; you need to explain. And if you've done something wrong, why not say sorry? You may not think it was wrong, but someone else did. You failed to communicate, so explain, and apologize.

I did not attempt to explain any of my entries in the [Things I've Done](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/12/04/lazy-blogging-just-one-of-the-things-ive-done/) post, but I'm going to use them to impose a little discipline on myself. And I apologize to the me that feels guilty about not blogging by indulging the me that enjoys constraints.
