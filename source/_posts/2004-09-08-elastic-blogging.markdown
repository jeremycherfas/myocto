I've realized of late that posting to my own blog is probably one of the most elastic tasks I have. If there's time, I do it. If there isn't, I don't. But I do at least fret about not posting. Sometimes.

One problem is that the primary cause of my current lack of both time and motivation is out of bounds for moaning. I have promised the powers that be that I won't discuss my work on my blog, it being far easier to self-censor than to explain. So I won't even indulge in a little _Roman a clef_ and disguise names to protect the guilty. Let's just say that life is not entirely smooth at present.<!-- more -->

There's been something on my mind too, to write about. To do with agricultural subsidies and such. But it is just going to have to wait.

I also still have some stuff to figure out on the geek front, like fixing the style for comments and working up a photo gallery. Or perhaps that could stay where it is? Dunstan had a really interesting post about [making links more usable](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/09/07/link-presentation-fitts-law/) that might merit some playing with.
