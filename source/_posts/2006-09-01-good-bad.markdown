The DVD of [Bad Santa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307987/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9YmFkIHNhbnRhfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=23;fm=1) skipped badly, so I sent it back. But I asked filmacasa.it to send me a fresh copy, because I just had to see whether and how Billy Bob Thornton's Santa could possible redeem himself. Which, being a Hollywood movie, he obviously had to. But they left it awful late. 

My rating: 3 out of 5
