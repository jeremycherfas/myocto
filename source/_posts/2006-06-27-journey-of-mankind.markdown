If, like me, you have been left a little confused by the explosion in studies of human migration based on inheritance of the Y chromosome, be prepared to be sorted out. The Bradshaw Foundation has a wonderful [animated map](http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/) that shows the various migration routes, their timing, and what was happening on the global weather front. This was, for me, a really useful summary.

Thanks to Luigi for the link. There's some other good stuff on the [foundation's home page](http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/), though I do wish it wouldn't click at me as I mouse over the tabs.
