John Gruber, a man whose opinions I value, thinks [Stock Names](http://stocknames.info/?utm_source=deck&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=wf-e) "[might be the cleverest promotion campaign I've ever seen](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/27/stock-names)". It's not bad, I agree, as a shill for something called Widgetfinger, a content management system. The claim is that the entire Stock Names page took less than 10 minutes from registering the domain name to appearing live on the intertubes.

Mebbe so. But I wouldn't be boasting about that. It looks like a pile of crap in Firefox.
