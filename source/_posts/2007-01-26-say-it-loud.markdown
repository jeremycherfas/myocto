... nerd and proud.

[Communicatrix](http://www.communicatrix.com/2007/01/nerd-love-01.html) is the best.

> Bottom line: true nerdsâ€”Good nerds, if you willâ€”don't think the world revolves around them. They have a healthy curiosity about the world around them, are always looking for new, cool, interesting stuff, and are continually improving themselves, whether they call it that or not. Nerds are helpful and additive, looking to make the world a better, more inclusive place (as opposed the world many of themâ€”usâ€”grew up in). Nerds don't leech off the system, step on people to get somewhere else, have grandiose notions of themselves or tell other people where to get off.
