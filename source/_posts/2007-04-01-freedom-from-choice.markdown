I do not normally consider myself in the linking-madly-diverse-bits-of-information-to-come-up-with-some-startling-new-perception game. But this past week, truly, two completely separate blog postings have dealt with the idea of simplicity and a good user experience from two entirely different perspectives. John Gruber at Daring Fireball analyses why [Apple's iCal is so horrible](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it) that he never uses it. (Neither do I, except to check a date, if there's nothing else to hand.) And Garr Reynolds has some posts on the liberating effect of [freedom from freedom of choice](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/03/happiness_decis.html), which takes as it's jumping-off point Barry Schwartz's Ted talk (which I really enjoyed and learned from when I watched it, way back when). And what they are both saying is that less choice can mean more happiness. Amen.
