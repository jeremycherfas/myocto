Hey, [New Scientist](http://agro.biodiver.se/2009/02/new-scientist-bottles-it/)! Yes, you, Roger Highfield, if your ego-trawl is working. [This](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/books/24berg.html?_r=1) is how you correct a mistake that someone who writes for you made:


> Correction: January 29, 2009
An article on Saturday about the book "The Other Side of Desire: Four Journeys Into the Far Realms of Lust and Longing," by Daniel Bergner, referred incorrectly to an enterprise of a woman known as the Baroness who is interviewed in the book. While she hosts what she describes as New York's longest-running fetish party, she does not run an S&M; dungeon.


This has been a public service announcement on behalf of [ethical bloggers](http://www.rebeccablood.net/handbook/excerpts/weblog_ethics.html) everywhere.
