Oh but this is interesting and creepy and ... well, let us just wait and see.

Nicholas Carr [posted about the Mechanical Turk](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/11/hits_for_hal.php) now [lurking within Amazon](http://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=whatis). the idea is simple and complex. People are better at some things than computers. So tell your computer program to enlist human help when it needs to. And [pay the human](http://www.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=whatis). Obviously I rushed on over, but I am way too late. The sign-up site is snowed under. Could be fun though.
