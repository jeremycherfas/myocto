I am developing an unhealthy obsession with nuns. After all, in the end they're probably more or less normal people, with the same hopes, fears, ambitions etc as the rest of us. But I still find it noteworthy when I see them doing more or less normal things. Like using laptop computers. And wearing groovy Birkenstocks.
