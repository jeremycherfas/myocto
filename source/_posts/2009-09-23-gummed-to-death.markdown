An unsolicited email from The Information Portal for the Public Sector promises amusement:


> **"We can't be anti everything!"** 
The UK Government's new Energy Adviser, David MacKay, gives a sound bite-free overview of the sustainable energy debate 

Love the exclamation point. Love even more the toothlessness of [Mr MacKay's overview](http://www.publicservice.co.uk/article.asp?publication=Science%20and%20Technology&id=390&content_name=Energy&article=12124). Or should that be overbite? Ah, the perils of half-baked [hyphenation](http://stancarey.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/hyphens-in-phrasal-adjectives/).
