That Murmuration video is getting a lot of mileage as people marvel at the flocking behaviour of starlings. I liked the way grrrlscientist took the opportunity to kinda sorta explain [how starlings do it](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/nov/08/1?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ResearchBloggingBiologyEnglish+%28Research+Blogging+-+English+-+Biology%29), even if the average reader is little wiser. OK, so they are tracking up to six of their nearest neighbours; now what? It did, however, serve to prompt a recollection of one of the first papers I remember reading on the subject, about flocking in dunlin. And that sent me scurrying to [Youtube, for this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZVbCC-gpxI). The great beauty of dunlin, of course, being that while they may not occupy space as effectively as starlings, they do have those white undersides.
