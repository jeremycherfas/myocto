I'm sure the good burghers of Rome, NY, are perfectly happy with this report in the [UticaOD](http://www.uticaod.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070712/NEWS/70712015)

> In other news, council members voted to designate a section of East Rome as the "Little Italy District."

Streets intersecting East Dominick Street, between Black River Boulevard and Panesi Avenue, will make up Rome's "Little Italy District."

The street signs also will be changed, beginning as early as the end of this week, to green signs with red letters. Signs also will read "Little Italy" in white.

Green, red and white are the colors of the Italian flag.

Councilman John Sparace, who sponsored the resolution, emphasized the importance of honoring the Italian immigrants who worked to develop Rome.

But for me it almost brought on a seizure as my poor brain tried to cope.
