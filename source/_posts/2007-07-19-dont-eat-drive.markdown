Or, drive to a vegetarian restaurant. [The Daily Telegraph reports](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/19/nbeef119.xml) on a New Scientist article that cites a Japanese study measuring the impact of 1 kilogramme of beef on global warming. Ah, but what kind of beef? And naturally I don't hold with the suggestion that we all go vegetarian.
