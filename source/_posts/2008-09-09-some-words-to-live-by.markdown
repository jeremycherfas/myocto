Well, yes and no. What I want to know is, why hide your agenda? What purpose does it serve? I'm reminded of the conversation between two fellow-traveller scriptwriters in the McCarthy era.

F-T S2: But that could get us black-listed!

F-T S1: Don't worry, we'll hide the message so well, no one will understand it.
