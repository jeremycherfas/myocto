![708561568 Cf5A8387Ac M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/708561568-cf5a8387ac-m.jpg) Enough with the melancholia accusations. This morning's [TedTalk](http://www.ted.com/speakers/view/id/198) put me in an entirely different frame of mind. Juggling! I love juggling. The Raspyni Brothers are [so web 2.0!](http://www.raspynibrothers.com/blog/) and funny with it. The best I've ever seen live were the Gandinis, ages ago at the Edinburgh Festival. The very notion of slo-mo juggling, the objects (pop bottles, IIRC) never actually been thrown blew me away. [They've moved on too](http://www.gandinijuggling.com/): just watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MfJVROQy8Q). I should have used a still with 18 clubs in the air as my image today. But what's with the Italian names?
