I'm not sure what the ethics of this are, but there's an article on food and farming in Cuba by Bill McKibben in Harper's Magazine, which Bill Totten's weblog has [posted in full](http://billtotten.blogspot.com/2005/04/cuba-diet.html). So I'm kind of happy linking to that.

Actually, all his posts seem to be re-posts.
