Spare a pair of panties for peace. Send them to the nearest embassy of Myanmar. Why panties? There's a full explanation [here](http://leahbowe.com/deathpower/2007/11/02/panty-protest-against-burmese-government/).

I've been away from the internets and hadn't seen that this story had received a bit of coverage. The campaign remains a smart piece of thinking. But wouldn't it just be better for a bunch of skirted women to climb to the top floor of every Burmese embassy and stay there?
