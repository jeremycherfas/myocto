[19 cities in the world with 20 million people in the 21st century](http://www.192021.org/) is a slide show that sets out a jaw-dropping agenda to study the near future. The slide are wonderful, so is the concept. One can but hope that the results will be too. Just one little niggle:  nowhere among the 14 "subjects of exploration" does the word "food" appear. Health, yes. Nutrition, no. Water sources, yes. Agriculture, no. Maybe sustenance will find its way into all the explorations, but somehow I doubt it.
