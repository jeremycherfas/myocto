![223140452 002241E035 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/223140452-002241e035-m.jpg) The next time it happened, I wasn't quite so surprised. It had been a Thursday. Now it was Tuesday. Roughly the same time, and there they were again; veils flapping, anoraks, running down the street. Theories began to form. Same time. Every day? Or every other day? No information on that one. Probably not late for something, not on two separate occasions, not all of them. It occurred to me that I might not be believed, so two days later, on Thursday a week ago, I confess I loitered on the corner with my camera. Nuns run. For fun?
