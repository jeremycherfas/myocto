I had a little time to spare so I thought I would try to get to grips with the way WordPress handles photos. But despite my best efforts I'm really not much closer to a good, elegant and simple solution. PictPress seems to be just too complicated. And things have moved on since I last looked. Flickr and Picasa both seem to be good places to store and share photos online, and other WordPress users seem to be able to feed albums from those sources onto their pages. I definitely need to look into this. But I also need to eat.
