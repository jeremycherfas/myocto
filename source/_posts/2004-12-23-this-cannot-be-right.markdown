![Belle Watling](http://images.quizilla.com/L/Lettie306/1037498216_windbellew.jpg)

You are Belle Watling. You are Atlanta's Bad Woman.  
The Madam of your own brothel, you make good  
money tending to the needs of the city  
gentlemen. Yet your occupation proves your  
personality otherwise. You can be quite gentle  
and motherly when the situation calls.
