Ah, how I remember my days as a CSICOP. If only we'd had to deal with completely sane nutters like Jennifer Dziura and her [paranormal vagina](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2006/7/10dziura.html) then, I'd probably still be in the game.

Another game I would love to have got into: [Guerilla Gardening](http://www.guerrillagardening.org/). They need a new website though, for sure.
