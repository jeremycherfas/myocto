Odd, this. The Guardian's Comment is Free site features a piece called [Eat the World](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/patrick_mulvaney/2006/12/mulvany.html), about the idea of imposing a carbon tax on food. Makes sense, in light of the Economist's recent swipes at do-gooding ethical shoppers. Written by someone called Patrick Mulvaney. Ah, I think, he's up to his old tricks again. But then, the photo is definitely not the Patrick Mulvaney I know, who hangs out [here](http://www.itdg.org/), although the content is right up his street. Turns out there are actually loads of the homonyms. Ah well, no matter. The piece is worth reading anyway.
