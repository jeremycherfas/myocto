A somewhat hectic day of toing and froing between the support forums for WordPress and [PixelPost](http://pixelpost.org/) has enabled me to put a little picture at the top of my right-hand menu. Not just any picture, mind you, but the latest picture uploaded from my [photoblog](http://photos.jeremycherfas.net/). Clicking on it takes you straight there.

Kudos to [Ramin Mehran](http://weblog.raminia.com/), a student in Tehran, for building a simple, useful [plug-in](http://weblog.raminia.com/wp-hacks/) and for being so helpful when it refused to work in my newbie hands.

Of course the PixelPost page still needs a little styling, but that's the bit I can do, and will. Eventually.
