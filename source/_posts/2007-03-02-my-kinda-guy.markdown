> The truth is, pedantry and non-pedantry can cut both ways. A pedant may vary from a dogged, uninquisitive, cloth-palated follower of orders to a devotee bent on doing everything right; while a non-pedant might be a simply lazy-bones or someone airy-fairily 'creative' in the worst, self-applauding way, or someone of justified confidence who has mastered technique and heard all the secret harmonies of the kitchen. I don't necessarily prefer being cooked for by a pedant; but I do have deep fellow-feeling for what is going on around the stove and inside the head.

["The Pedant in the Kitchen" (Julian Barnes)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1843542404%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1843542404%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002), a wonderful Christmas gift that I devoured a week or so back but could not find the time before now to share.
