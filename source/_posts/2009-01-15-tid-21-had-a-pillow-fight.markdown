And until this very moment -- searching Flickr for a picture -- I had no idea that big public pillow fights took place, at least in [San Francisco](http://sanfrancisco.about.com/b/2008/02/11/the-great-san-francisco-pillow-fight.htm) and Paris. I suppose it is all good clean fun, except for the feathers. I did a little bit of research, but aside from the fact of the events, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of explanation. You can [watch a video](http://dailymotion.alice.it/video/188966). I did, for a few seconds. And you can see [a great photo of the Beatles](http://www.harrybenson.com/index.php#mi=2&pt=1&pi=10000&s=1&p=4&a=0&at=0), pioneers in this, as in other things.
