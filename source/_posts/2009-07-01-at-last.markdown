For three days now thunder has rumbled around Rome, always on the horizon, promising much, delivering nothing. Until now. I was hoping for the best, and hoping too that the old umbrella voodoo [^fn1] would not be effective. And I was right. We were down on the flatlands, the dog and I, when big fat drops sizzled down onto the red concrete pavement. I wish I'd had a camera with me to record the way the individual drops slowly merged until the whole surface was darkened, and then the accumulation became visible as real wet water. Glorious, even if I did get soaked from the knees on down.

The storm didn't really last long enough to clear the air, but there are still rumblings so perhaps we'll get more. I do hope so.

[^fn1]: Carrying an umbrella _prevents_ rain.
