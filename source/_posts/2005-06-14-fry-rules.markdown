Futurama fans, go [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nachop/sets/450093/), and give thanks, in Spanish, to [Sr Nacho](http://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/peliculas-tv/futurama-taglines.html).

One problem with hanging around in front of del.ici.ous instead of, say, watching dirty movies, is that you find stuff like [this bloke](http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/things.html) and the things he argues with his grilfriend about and the whole evening drifts by.
