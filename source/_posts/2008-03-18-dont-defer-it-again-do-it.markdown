[![519191994 E7D407B117 T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/519191994-e7d407b117-t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/yanbing/519191994/) I'm a [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/) guy; not obsessively, but enough. I delete, delegate (_[magari](http://www.wordreference.com/iten/magari)_), do and defer, and that gets me through my days with a minimum of dropped balls. Defer is the big problem. Not the emails deferred to my @action box; I scan that regularly, and do them in time set aside for that. The problem is the items I plan to read or do something about later. Google Reader and Del.icio.us make it so easy to defer, but somehow the stream seldom dries up enough to do. Defer turns into defeated. And that's not good.
