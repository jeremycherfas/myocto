[They](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2020790,00.html) envy us our [freedom](http://www.quietagent.com/superbowl/)?

Later ...

Oh dear, the legal gag has really got going, so now I have to explain. The second of my links above was to a very fine advertisement for Quiet Agent, a job-seekers' web site, to be screened at the Superbowl. It featured George Bush thinking about a possible new career. In the background were illustrations of the careers he was thinking of. Rather good satire. Of course the ABC network didn't see it like that, and refused to screen the spot.  Now it has gone.


> Dear visitor, as of 1700 hrs on Thursday 2nd February, we were advised by our legal department that due to possible legal ramifications, we are to remove this commercial from our site.


Later still ...
Seems people are finding this entry when they search for QuietAgent. So I'm, going to make life easier by adding [a link to the offending advert](http://www.boredmuch.com/view.php?id=854), so kindly supplied by Ryan in the comments.
