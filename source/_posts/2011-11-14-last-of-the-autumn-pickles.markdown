Just finished putting up what may prove to be the last of this season's [dill pickles](http://jeremycherfas.net/2011/09/24/cucumbers-fermented-beautifully/); four litres, 12 cucumbers. The dill is still going strong, and there are cucs in the market, but I fear that the secret ingredient -- grape leaves -- will not be available again till spring.

And having done that, I thought it might be a good idea finally to edit the silly little video I shot making the second (or was it the third?) batch.
