It is so pleasant to read intemperate ravings. At least when they **are** readable. Anyone who manages to skewer competitive cooking and naff sports in one piece deserves a [read](http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=304952005). So, for that matter, does a [book review](http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,1435639,00.html) that says:

> "There is, in fact, no firm evidence to prove that any Christian was ever torn apart by lions inside the Colosseum."

The book's probably a good read too.
