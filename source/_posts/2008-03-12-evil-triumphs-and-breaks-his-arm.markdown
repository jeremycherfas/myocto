Finally got to see [No Country for Old Men](http://imdb.com/title/tt0477348/) over the weekend, and boy was it worth it. I don't know that I can remember a film as full of suspense. I heard an interview with the sound designer, I think it was, who explained how the Coens had insisted on almost no music and how he had assembled the sound of Chigurh's captive bolt. Had it not been for that, I might not have noticed the sound of the lightbulb unscrewing as Llewelyn waits in the hotel room, gun across his lap, one of the most edge-of-seat sequences I've sat through. Not a lot to say that hasn't already been said. Luigi (that's his line in the headline up there) and I talked a bit about people with strong codes, and how the only person left alive was dead inside. Also about random acts of violence and the fact that you didn't see the death of any sympathetic character. They got theirs offscreen. Which is nice. Now I need to reread the book.

My rating: 4.5 out of 5
