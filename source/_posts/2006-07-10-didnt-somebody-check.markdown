Anyone got a cheek swab?

There's a minor frisson of excitement about Salvino Madonia, the Italian mafioso who has been [permitted to get his wife pregnant ](http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7004146435)by artificial insemination. While I'm not all that sure about his resource-holding potential, I am far more intrigued about a couple of other aspects of the story. To whit:


> Investigators were baffled when the couple's first child was born in 2000, while Madonia was already in detention and was theoretically barred from having any private encounter with his wife.

Madonia married in prison. Authorities aren't sure how he impregnated his wife, "although it is suspected that artificial insemination was also used on that occasion". Call me an old cynic, or even a biologist, but is anyone certain that it was indeed Madonia who impregnated his wife?

Nor is this anything new. [ANSA's report](http://ansa.it/main/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2006-07-06_1065804.html) gives a little more background.


> In 1997 two Mafia boss brothers, Giuseppe and Filippo Graviano, managed to become fathers by different women while they were in a high security jail . Investigators suspected for a time that their lawyer had played a hand in the business but this was never proved.

Finest bit of yellow innuendo I've seen in a long, long time.
