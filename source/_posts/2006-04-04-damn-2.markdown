Started messing with some redesign -- based on a nice and clean WordPress theme. And I like it, even out of the box. There are things I want to tweak, like body font, header etc., to make it look less generic. But I like it well enough, for now.

Oddly, the number of comments is still all wrong.


Later ... the comments thing is odd -- earlier posts, it remains wrong, later ones it is fixed. Voodoo.
