Back from a couple of weeks of wonderful holiday, and Rome is hot and empty, as is usual in August. The best news is that not everything on the terrace died. The automatic irrigation system I bought and installed six weeks or so ago was in one respect a mistake; being cheap, it is not very adjustable, just three or four durations and three or four frequencies. In the lead-up to leaving I fiddled with the sprays and drippers and whatnot and got an arrangement that seemed to work, watering twice a day for 15 minutes each time. Some plants, notably the beans and the moonflowers, were getting too little and some, maybe the mandevillas, too little. But it worked well enough that I went on holiday without too much to worry about.

Of course, that didn't stop me worrying, or at least wondering, whether everything was holding up. So as soon as I had popped the new Coleus cuttings I snagged over there into water I headed out to the terrace to survey the damage. Nothing major! The rosemary had fallen over and hence wasn't getting any water at all; I suspect it is toast, but have attempted a rescue. The bidens too was brown and brittle, but beneath it there seem to be some little seedlings with the same sort of leaf structure, so I'll keep an eye on those. A sprawling verbena was one of the victims of too little water, but aside from those, everything else is at least still alive. Indeed, things like the plumeria and the banana were positively thriving.

One discovery: mandevilla seedlings, which popped up earlier this spring like mustard and cress, can make do with far less water than I thought they needed. One pot that had fallen over was thriving far better than those that had continued to be dripped on.

But the best news, by far, is that my home-saved tomato seeds had fruited prolifically and that these fruits do not seem to have the blossom end rot that the very first ones suffered. The variety is unknown. We buy it almost through the whole winter from the little shop up the road that specializes in stuff from Puglia. It is sold green, and has a wonderful flavour, acid and sweet at the same time, meaty and chewy without being tough. I saved seeds this spring, and here it is going all out and producing fruits that are every bit as tasty as the ones we buy. At least, I think they are.

The ones on the terrace had ripened well beyond the green stage, and they were still very good, so I'm wondering why the Pugliese pick them green. Maybe just because they can. I'm going to save another bunch of seeds from this lot and distribute them to see how it does in other places. Stay tuned.

The moonflower vines have several flowers in various stages of development, including one that I probably missed opening last night and another that I'm probably missing even as I type this. I expect I'll have to [play giant moth](http://entweb.clemson.edu/buttrfly/Educatn/moonflwr.pdf) if I want seeds for next year.
