![87056157 7B77Cf9707 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/87056157-7b77cf9707-m.jpg) From the morning's round with the dog, when we marveled at the big trees brought down in the Villa Sciara, to the evening's leek and potato soup with fresh-baked bread, it has been a fine day. It's always nice not to have to go to work, but even better when there isn't anything all that pressing to do at home. A bit of cooking, a bit of blogging, a bit of wandering the byways of the intertubes. I always think I could be reasonably happy if that were how most days went, but possibly not.
