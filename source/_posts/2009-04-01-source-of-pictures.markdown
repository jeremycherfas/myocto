[Life.com](http://www.life.com/) has put a huge number of images online. The trick is to use the date slider to refine your search.There are two ways to share the images. One, to embed, as above. The other, to link directly, as below, but that seems not to work so well. I'm testing it here to see what happens to sizing.
