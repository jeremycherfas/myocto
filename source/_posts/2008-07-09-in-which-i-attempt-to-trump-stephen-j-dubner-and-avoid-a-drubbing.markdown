This is really dangerous. I'm going way out on a limb here. Given the trouncing [Dubner](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/dept-of-oops/) got yesterday, I really should be more circumspect. But hey, what the heck?

There was a really silly mistake in _The Economist_ last week.

I am so glad I got that off my chest.

In a [book review](http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11662237), we read that "her father became an alcoholic, addicted to prescriptive drugs, chronically adulterous and so violent that divorce was inevitable."

I wondered what a prescriptive drug might be. A drug you are required to take, by someone else, the pharmaceutical equivalent of a grammar nazi? Or a typo? Or something else entirely, a usage I was unfamiliar with. Chastened by Dubner's fate, I turned to Google.

I'm no expert at these [super spiffy searches](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=299) that the Language Log mavens use all the time, but I did find '[about 7,340 English pages for "prescriptive drugs"](http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&as_q=&as_epq=prescriptive+drugs&as_oq=&as_eq=&num=10&lr=lang_en&as_filetype=&ft=i&as_sitesearch=&as_qdr=all&as_rights=&as_occt=any&cr=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&safe=images)' as against '[about 8,290,000 English pages for "prescription drugs"](http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&as_q=&as_epq=prescription+drugs&as_oq=&as_eq=&num=10&lr=lang_en&as_filetype=&ft=i&as_sitesearch=&as_qdr=all&as_rights=&as_occt=any&cr=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&safe=images)'. That seemed pretty persuasive to me, but just in case I went to the first five hits for "prescriptive drugs". Here's what I found.

	
  * [The Free Dictionary.](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prescription+drug) Doesn't count; the word prescriptive is there, but not next to the word drug.

	
  * [Drugs.com.](http://www.drugs.com/) Doesn't count; the word prescriptive isn't even visibly there.

	
  * [Cartoonstock.com](http://www.cartoonstock.com/directory/p/prescriptive_drugs.asp). Lame joke that does indeed use "prescriptive drugs" but I fancy is making the same mistake.

	
  * [WikiAnswers](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_about_the_prescriptive_drugs). "What is about the prescriptive drugs?" Doesn't count; utterly meaningless rubbish. Not surprised that "this question has not been answered yet".

	
  * [Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore](http://www.pss.org.sg/main/content/view/47/2/). Bingo! At last, someone using it in the same mistaken sense as The Economist, as "prescription drug".

All of which is really rather gratifying.

Now, please, please, please, let me have avoided [Hartman's Law](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002035.html), in any of its guises. [^fn1]
