[Susan lays it on the line:](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/2009/12/15/pandoro/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+WildYeast+%28Wild+Yeast%29)

> Like its cousin panettone, pandoro is an involved bread. It requires a carefully-planned schedule, some ingredients and equipment you might not have on hand (but are readily available), and close attention during the final mixing process. That said, I would not discourage beginning bakers from attempting this. If you can follow directions and are in possession of a vigorous sourdough starter, you’re 90% there! I’d say if you have the fortitude to read this very hefty post, you have the fortitude to make pandoro.

Or I could pop round to the supermarket and stand paralysed and unable to choose for 5 minutes or more.
