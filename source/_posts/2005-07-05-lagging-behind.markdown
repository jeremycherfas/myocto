How I hate travelling west to east. I've done everything I can -- stayed up late, taken my [melatonin](http://general-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/1999/924/1) -- and still here I am awake at an ungodly hour. Falling asleep is not the problem. I'm ready to nap any time. Staying asleep is the difficulty. Perhaps an hour surfing is what I need. But then it will be time to get up for real. No win.
