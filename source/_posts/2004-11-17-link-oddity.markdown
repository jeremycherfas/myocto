How strange. I had previously seen an [article](http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?041122fa_fact) by Malcolm Gladwell in the Popular section of del.icio.us, but ignored it until it popped up today on [fimoculous](http://www.fimoculous.com/). Went there, scanned it, decided to download it to read tonight. But lo, the printer-friendly page button diverted me to a completely different article by Roger Angell. A teeny bit of sleuthing later I discovered that there was an additional "1" on the end of the printer-friendly link. It is http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/041122fa_fact1 and it should be http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/041122fa_fact.

I have no idea how this sort of thing happens, but it surprised me because I thought big magazines had completely automatic fancy CMSs to handle delivery. Do they make mistakes? Or are they merely human?
