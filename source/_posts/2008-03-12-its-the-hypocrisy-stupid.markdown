Spitzer's shame is no direct concern of mine, although it is staggering that these powerful dudes seriously imagine that they won't get caught. I mean, what are they, 19-year old drunk drivers who believe themselves immortal? And I won't myself deign to consider why they can't just Keep It In Their Pants. Fortunately, I don't have to, because [Jaquandor](http://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/) and [Lance](http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/) have both nailed the key elements of this story: [hypocrisy](http://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/2008/03/hookers-for-me-but-not-for-thee.html) and [extravagance](http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2008/03/let-the-one-amo.html).
