"Don't let anyone use 'ID' and 'theory' in the same sentence." Sage advice from R. Joe Brandon, organizer of a petition to muster scientists against the teaching of intelligent design in science lessons. The Petition raised 7733 signatures, mine among them, in just four days. the Discovery Institute took four years to raise just 400 names.

There's lots more at the [press release](http://shovelbums.org/content/view/155/526/).

This won't actually make any difference. I know that. But it feels good nevertheless.

... later ... for proof of how much it matters, and how little will change, check out the disgraceful no. 92 on [this list](http://www.nationalreview.com/script/printpage.p?ref=/flashback/flashback200510190827.asp). One could argue about some of the omissions, but the inclusion of that crap leaves me gasping.

... later still ... thanks to del.icio.us I managed a hearty laugh at the end of a gruelling day. [You can too](http://abstractfactory.blogspot.com/2005/10/only-debate-on-intelligent-design-that.html).
