Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.3 This week: 88.5
**Tuesday 11 September:** Slowly getting back to where I was, and that despite one of the most delicious steaks I have eaten in a long time. Against the odds, this was cooked in a domestic kitchen, at his home, by a friend. Too often the best home-cooked steak is not much better than the worst restaurant steak, mostly because people don't use enough heat and don't let the meat rest. A smoke-filled kitchen and a mouth-watering wait while the meat recovered on a board (there were other things to do, which is just as well) proved that last week's host knew what he was doing. I expected no less. Thanks to both for their hospitality.
