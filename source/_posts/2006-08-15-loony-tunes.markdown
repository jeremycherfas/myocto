![Itunes Nonsense](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/iTunes%20nonsense.jpg) 

Don't get me wrong. I like the iTunes Music Store and the way it seemlessly worms its way into my life. Plus there's cool free stuff. So when I read that there was a [new page listing free videos](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/08/14/apple-creates-itunes-free-video-page/), I popped on over. iTunes, in its infinite wisdom, always transfers me to the Italian shop. And the Italian shop knows nothing about no stinkin' free videos. Not only that, it knows nothing about counting. In case you can't see, it is showing me Page 1 of 0.
