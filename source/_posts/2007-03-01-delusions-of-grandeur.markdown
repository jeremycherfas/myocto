[The Viscount](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/2007/02/who-said-this.html) draws attention both to his overall enjoyment of [The God Delusion](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0593055489%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0593055489%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) but also to one of the choicer quotes that Richard Dawkins exhumed to help his argument along. I too massively enjoyed the book and many of the bits that Dawkins himself did not write. In fact, I made a little list, and the single Dawkins phrase that tickled me most was this one:

> We doctors call that kind of linkage _linkage_, and I shall say no more about it ... 

What another colleague called, if I remember aright, "the flickering stilettos of scholarship" don't come much sharper than that.
