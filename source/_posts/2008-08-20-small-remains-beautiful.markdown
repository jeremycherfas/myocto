When it comes to food safety, big industry is simply a big bully. And government does the bully boy's work. I'm frankly agnostic about whether clean raw milk is good or bad for one's health, but the attempt to run it out of town on a rail is further evidence of the way in which food safety regulations have been subverted.

Thanks to [John Schwenkler](http://johnschwenkler.wordpress.com/) for doing the legwork.
