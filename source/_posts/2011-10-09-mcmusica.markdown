Puzzled by an advert in yesterday's Repubblica, but without time to check it, was very pleased to have Jess point me to this wire story. [Italy's top chef teaming up with McDonalds - ANSA English](http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/10/04/visualizza_new.html_695422541.html).

> The "Vivace" (vivacious) is a burger topped with bacon, salted spinach, marinated onions and mayonaise with mustard seeds.

The "Adagio" (slowly, like the musical term) is also a hamburger, topped with sweet-and-sour eggplant strips, sliced tomatoes and salted ricotta, all between a bun covered in sliced almonds.

Both sandwiches go for 4.70 euros.

They're only available for three weeks. TheÂ dilemma: break the habit of a lifetime in order to explore new frontiers in eating, or dismiss it as entirely silly without tasting?
