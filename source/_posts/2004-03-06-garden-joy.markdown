Just spent three or four hours enjoyably doing what passes for gardening around these parts. That's mostly sweeping up the debris that accumulates on the terrace and removing the adventitious plant life, mostly chickweed and pelletory with the occasional vicious Roman nettle, that establishes itself in all the pots and troughs. Two observations.

Dried, brittle basil twigs still smell powerfully of basil.

Nothing, but nothing, established itself under the _Lantana_ bush. Is that one of the reasons it is considered such a noxious weed? Apparently so, according to a quick Google after the event.
