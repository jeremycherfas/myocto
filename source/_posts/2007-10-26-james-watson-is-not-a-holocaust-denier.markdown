I Googled "[+Ahmadinejad +Watson](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2BAhmadinejad+%2BWatson&btnG=Search)" and was pretty astounded to find almost nothing. Doing the same on [Blogsearch](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&utm_source=AdWords&utm_campaign=us-ha-en-blogsearch&utm_term=blogsearch&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=googleblogsearch&q=%2BAhmadinejad+%2BWatson&btnG=Search+Blogs) provided three items. [Undemocracy in America](http://undemocracy.blogspot.com/2007/10/ahmadinejad-1-watson-0.html), [Wired Blog Network](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/10/british-science.html) and  [Sweetness and Light](http://sweetness-light.com/archive/lab-suspends-watson-for-his-thought-crimes) all make the comparison that for a couple of weeks I have thought way too obvious to bother here with. But really, the Iranian President is given a hero's welcome at Columbia University, while pusillanimous scientists censor one of their own?

You couldn't make it up.
