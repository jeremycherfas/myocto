It is awful what has happened, and the blame game is unedifying at best. But there's some interesting stuff happening on the margins. Like Mark Childress's [list](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/fashion/sundaystyles/04easy.html?ei=5070&en=5a9dd455a304841e&ex=1125979200&adxnnl=1&pagewanted=print&adxnnlx=1125954183-NUAjvqtPX0ACAlYDjTFxvA) over at the New York Times. No. 14 is, of course, the give-away.
