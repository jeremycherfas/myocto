Brave new world. I've read all about how easy it is to foist podcasts on an unsuspecting audience, but never had the need, until now.

Good heavens! That actually seems to work, at least as far as being able to listen by clicking on the link above. It was not exactly a cinch. I had to futz about doing far too much by hand. And I have no idea yet whether people will be able to subscribe or download the programme to iTunes and the like. But it is a start.

The content, you ask? Episode 1 of a four-part series I made for a well-known broadcaster some years back. I hope they don't mind.
