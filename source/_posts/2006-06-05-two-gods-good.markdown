God bless the [Viscount LaCarte](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/). He pointed me to [Anita](http://anitasnewblog.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/06/dylan_cash_.html), who pointed me to [The Heretik](http://theheretik.us/), who had this clip of Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. I'm going to attempt the very web 2.0 feat of saving you the clicktrain.
