Almost two years ago a woman was arrested in Melbourne when customs officers heard [suspicious "flipping" noises](http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=623802005) emanating from beneath her skirts. I remember it, because [I blogged it](http://jeremycherfas.net/2005/06/07/surprise/). At last, the case has come to trial, but [the report](http://bymnews.com/news/newsDetails.php?id=4437) that alerted me does not give details of the sentence. She's doing [nine months](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/customs-nets-fine-catch-as-skirt-reveals-51-fish/2007/03/02/1172338882547.html).
