![1253350853 2C3E51E1E8 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/1253350853-2c3e51e1e8-m.jpg) While I'm not above stealing content occasionally, if I feel it is necessary, so many people have released their work with some form of [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license that there really is no need. What's more, the quality is often astonishing. It's also often truly appalling. The same is true of copyrighted material. Which figures. Adding the numbers to these posts has required little more than [going and looking](http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-nc-nd-2.0/) for numbers. And I found them, and it is enormous fun looking. As for the superstition angle, seventeen is the one to avoid here. How do you explain that?
