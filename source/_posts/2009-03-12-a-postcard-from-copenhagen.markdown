Boffins are worrying that when Australian farmers can sell carbon sequestration, they might prefer to earn more doing that than growing wheat. That will increase the world price of wheat. So the farmers will grow wheat. So what happens to the carbon?

But we can do both; increase yield by increasing soil carbon

Eat less meat, says dismal. No, that would increase greenhouse gas emissions for may people in may parts of the world, says Win-win.

Is it any wonder nobody can decide what on earth to do.
