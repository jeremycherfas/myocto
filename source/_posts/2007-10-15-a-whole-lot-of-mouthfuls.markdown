Just for a laugh, I went on the hunt at Science Blogs, searching for "[agriculture](http://scienceblogs.com/sample/fastsearch?order=date&IncludeBlogs=49%2C101%2C83%2C3%2C11%2C8%2C97%2C55%2C64%2C10%2C60%2C22%2C80%2C15%2C95%2C78%2C52%2C4%2C48%2C45%2C63%2C14%2C25%2C53%2C50%2C42%2C89%2C5%2C47%2C90%2C96%2C9%2C62%2C104%2C16%2C38%2C67%2C43%2C73%2C81%2C99%2C44%2C79%2C103%2C23%2C7%2C41%2C46%2C17%2C61%2C82%2C54%2C74%2C92%2C85%2C93%2C21%2C12%2C65%2C86%2C75%2C72%2C6%2C91%2C51%2C100%2C%2C101%2C103&search=agriculture&x=0&y=0)". I read the first 15 entries.


  1. About an artist who wanted to examine GM agriculture.
  2. About pollution from intensive chicken operations.
  3. About fund-raising for schools in the US, one of which is in an agricultural district.
  4. About academia in northeast China.
  5. About that fund-raising again, from an agriculture teacher (who wants to buy forestry equipment).
  6. About bird 'flu, blaming poultry for the problem.
  7. About industrial agriculture, lambasting Dow Chemical.
  8. About industrial agriculture, and _E. coli_ in hamburger.
  9. About parking being more polluting than agriculture.
  10. Another one about bird 'flu, in Indonesia.
  11. About agriculture and human diversity.
  12. About diet changes in the Mesolithic.
  13. About how agriculture permitted epidemics of disease by increasing population density.
  14. About the rise of industrial agriculture and fall of farmers.
  15. About resistance developing among pests in organic apples orchards.
All very interesting. and I'm not complaining. (Well, I am, a bit.) But truly, aren't people interested in farming as ecology, or as an evolutionary experimental lab, or as selection in action, or as a driver of human change, or, or, or?

Those 15 posts take us back to October 1st, so it isn't as if there is a shortage of posts that contain the word "agriculture". But they're not really about how we feed ourselves.

I'm just sayin' is all, possibly because over at [The Other Place](http://agro.biodiver.se/2007/10/time-flies-when-youre-having-fun/) we've just celebrated a year of blogging about agricultural biodiversity, agrobiodiversity, agro-eco-biodiversity and a whole lot of other mouthfuls. Literally.
