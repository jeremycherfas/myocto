_Was it really on_ [_23 January_](http://jeremycherfas.net/2009/01/23/tid-33-seen-niagara-falls-in-person/) _that I temporarily abandoned these attempts to expand on the_ [_Things I've Done_](http://jeremycherfas.net/2008/12/04/lazy-blogging-just-one-of-the-things-ive-done/)_? Wonder how long I'll last this time? Longer if I don't try to be fancy about illustrations._

This language thing is a farce. When I drove down here, more than eight years ago, I listened to tapes of conversational Italian, and arrived with a rudimentary and serviceable ability to say what I wanted. Then I had lessons, and tried to learn fancy forms of verbs, and even read newspapers. And now I'm convinced that I have barely the skills of a 4 year old, if that. I get by, and Italian is new to me, but I also find it frustrating not to be able either to just chat or to discuss ideas. Immersion would be a good idea.
