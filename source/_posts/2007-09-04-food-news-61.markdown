Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.? This week: 89.3
**Tuesday 4 September:** As if to mock me for saying that "what you eat is up to you" last time, I return from a very social holiday 2 kg heavier. But it was all so good! Particularly deadly, of course, are little buffets, where the only portion control is in your mind, and it is always possible to force down one more stuffed vine leaf, or just another scoop of home-made salsa. Deadly.
