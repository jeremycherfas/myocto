[Dubner does it right](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/pasties-pasties-everywhere/). So does The Economist.

I do take issue with the comment that Dubner had "encountered Muphry's law". This was not Muphry, this was a [miscorrection](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=210), plain and simple.

All that's left for me to rail against are the commenters; [Sturgeon's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law) personified.
