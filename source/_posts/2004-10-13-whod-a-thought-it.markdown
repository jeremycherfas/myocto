A [new strategy](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65317,00.html) beats tit-for-tat at the Prisoners' Dilemma. Southampton University's approach was pretty sneaky, essentially allowing its prisoners to recognize one another and cooperate. Up against a non-Southampton opponent, prisoners deliberately throw their own chances to make life easier for their colleagues. Neat. I wonder how the new approach will fare when the competition is re-run early in 2005?

Oh, and [this](http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/how-to-help.html) could be useful to someone out there.
