Escaping the rising waters of the Tiber, I arrive in Casablanca. No, really. Not as a final destination, but en route to Marrakech. And when you're stuck in an international airport, where a Gold Frequent Flyer card gets you nothing but abuse because you are not leaving the country, and you've read, if not exactly digested, all the papers for your forthcoming meeting, and life is generally dull, what could be more fun than to fire up the old iBook and see if there's free wireless. And there is.

Hence, a more than usually content free posting. [Not that I'm alone in that regard](http://homepage.mac.com/rdraymond/iblog/C1862716541/E1731576140/index.html). See me blog there.
