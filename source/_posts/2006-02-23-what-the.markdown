Handy blogging tip No. 381: Blocked? Check your stats!

Why on Earth was someone searching Yahoo for [free animal privets](http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=sbc-web&tab=&p=free+animal+privets&btn=Search)?

And will this post now beat out the one result for "animal privets," which seems to be a splog that I'm not going to bother linking to.

p.s. The searches for [guinea](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2005/11/19/parastatanoia/) [pig](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2005/11/06/whats-with-the-guinea-pigs/) [images](http://jeremycherfas.net/wp/archives/2004/09/22/lunch/) just go on and on.
