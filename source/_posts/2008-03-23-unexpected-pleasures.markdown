![471810567 E93Ebb0Ce5 M](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/471810567-e93ebb0ce5-m.jpg) It has been windy and raining for three days, on and off, mostly on. We went to a friend in the countryside and spent the time indoors reading by the fire. Last night, in a momentary break, I took the dog out, and my jaw dropped. Big black clouds were sailing in stately manner past the brightest full moon I can remember in a long time. Cloud rims shone silver, their interiors blacker than the night, and from time to time the moon broke brilliantly free.

Back home, the wind had blown one of the two lemons from the tree.
