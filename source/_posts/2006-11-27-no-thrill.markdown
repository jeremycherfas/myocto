There's a clear metaphor at the heart of [Wasabi](http://imdb.com/title/tt0281364/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9d2FzYWJpfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1): Jean Reno sucks great gobbets of the aforementioned cruciferous paste from his fingertips and evinces no emotion, no stimulation, whatsoever. He's **that** hard. Or, alternatively, this wasabi is entirely without heat. Take your pick. One thing's for certain. [LÃ©on](http://imdb.com/title/tt0110413/), it ain't.
