Start: 95.4 Last week: 88.3  This week: ??.?

**Tuesday 26 September:** Away for work, and surrounded by good food, with not a scale in sight. The oil travelled with me in an ordinary small water bottle and didn't spill a drop, so that's good to know. And I have tried to keep down my intake, without any difficulty. I certainly don't feel as if I am gaining, but I probably am.
