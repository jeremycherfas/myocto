It is just too bad. The cucumbers in the market are plentiful, small and cheap. San Diego Food Stuff just published her [family recipe for Dill Pickles](http://www.sandiegofoodstuff.com/2011/07/dill-pickle-lust-revived.html), with the elusive and vital information about how much salt to use, for this is not a vinegar pickle, no sir. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: I wrote at length about this a couple of decades ago; can I find that piece now? 

 But have I got any dill? Well, yes, a long row, but they're only a couple of centimetres tall. And where does one find fresh dill in Rome? Maybe at Piazza Vittoria, but then again maybe not.

No matter. I have copied out the recipe, noting that a cherry leaf or two, or even a grape leaf (both much more easily obtained than fresh dill) are vastly preferable to Ball® Pickle Crisp® Granules, whatever they are. [^fn1]
[^fn1]: "Easy-to-use product that makes pickles crisp without the cumbersome process of soaking produce for hours in lime and repeated rinsing." 

 And the cucumbers will be around a while yet. Perhaps I'll hunt dill next week.
