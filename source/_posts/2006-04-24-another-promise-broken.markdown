Italy is asking immigrant families to [return a baby bonus](http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7003279821).

> The problem started with a pre-election letter by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. It read: "Best wishes for your arrival, do you know that the budget has put aside 1,000 euros for you? Big Kiss. Silvio Berlusconi."
> 
> 

The letter was sent to all parents of new babies. It was intended only for Italians. Now the government wants the money back.

(And yes, I found her blog because she blog-rolled me.)
