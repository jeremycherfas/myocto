Luigi pointed me [here,](http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=13183) saying "kinda sick but they have a point",  and he's not wrong. The article says Powerpoint carries some of the blame for the Columbia shuttle crash. Even more interesting is the great Edward Tufte's [analysis](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Rs&topic_id=1&topic=Ask%20E.T) of the slide in question, which I see was posted in March 2003. So what, I wonder, woke the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/14POWER.html?ex=1071982800&en=799ad449b398c2d7&ei=5062&partner=GOOGLE) (The Inquirer's source) to cover it now?
