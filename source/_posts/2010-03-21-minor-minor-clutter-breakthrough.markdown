Or perhaps it wasn't. But it feels as if it could have been. After a surgical strike on IKEA early this morning I assembled my Besta as best as I could. (Oh God, the wit of it.) And then -- here's the breakthrough -- I ditched all the bits and pieces I didn't need for this particular configuration. Not just the Allen keys, but the little bit of tape to stick it to the wall and the small screw in legs and the bits for joining two of them together. Just threw them out, with all the packaging. I've convinced myself that I won't in fact need them just in case at some point in the future and that it'll be handy to have them around. Feels good enough to write about.
