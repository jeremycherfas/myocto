I've kept out of the atheism evolution silliness recently because I just don't get any reward from it. But that doesn't mean I think that the film _[Expelled](http://expelledexposed.com/)_ should get any more exposure than it already has. So when PZ issues [a call to arms](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/bloggers_you_have_a_job_to_do.php), my arms are his arms, yea, unto the eighth.

And I see I'm in [very good company](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/denis036/thisweekinevolution/2008/04/dumbing_down_intelligent_desig.html), with people who have made their response part of something worth saying, as opposed to my doing just enough.
