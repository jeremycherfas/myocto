I just opened my second 10kg bag of [Bongiovanni](http://www.molinobongiovanni.com/) [^fn1]
[^fn1]: A web page that sucks; anyone else remember those? Well [they're still there](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/dailysucker/). 

 type 0 high protein organic bread flour. Total cost of flour plus some other goodies, almost 34.75. I decided that the bread stash could reimburse me for its raw materials, which it now has without too much pain. Not enough dough to give up the day job, but satisfaction beyond rubies.
