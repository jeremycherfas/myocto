George Monbiot has posted about his [allotment gardening](http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/10/01/growing-my-own/). Nothing totally revolutionary, but a couple of fine observations. One is that the appliance of science really did make life easier, in the long run. Eighteen months may be a bit too long for some people to wait for a weed-free plot, and I'm not sure I would have been as purist about the use of glyphosate. But then, George has a much higher profile than me. The other is the use of protective fleece. worth its weight in gold, that stuff. And needless to say, his piece provoked pangs of longing.
