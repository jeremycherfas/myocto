![](/uploads/2011/01/CHDK.png)This morning on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jeremy.cherfas) I leaked that I had "two kinds of messing about commingling to produce ... something rather wonderful". And finally, the results are in. Not wonderful, but not bad either.

Messing about number 1: making Dan Lepard's Black Pepper Rye bread, in quantity. There's not a lot I have to add to [previous postings](http://jeremycherfas.net/2009/11/15/black-pepper-rye-and-bakers-math/) on the subject. I now have it down pat, more or less, adding 50 ml extra water per loaf to the scalded rye before mixing in the salt, yeast and the remainder of the flour. That gives a much lighter dough which, while sticky, is hugely easier to handle than the version I get from the recipe unaltered. This loaf has absolutely become one of my alltime favourites, always reliable, always tasty, and always gratifying.

Messing about number 2: installing CHDK on my Canon Powershot SD550. CHDK is the [Canon Hack Development Kit](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK). In essence it unlocks all the little features that Canon, in its wisdom, restricts in most of its cameras (which is almost certainly A Good Thing). It also has a scripting language that allows you to control the camera and persuade it to do things surely unthinkable in a point-and-shoot.

[![Lightning 1](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/4702572718_a582075c7f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/abelardo/4702572718/) Like capturing lightning. Or [HDR timelapse movies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc_M0oGsQj4). And lots of other things too, such as taking movies from the edge of space and what have you. I originally got it to play with shooting RAW on the G7 I just inherited from the Main Squeeze. Not that there's anything wrong with the G7's JPGs, just that I think a person who considers himself a bit of a photographer needs to understand how to work with RAW files. Pretty geeky, huh? Anyway, having unleashed the G7's might, I didn't want the SD550 to feel abandoned, so I CHDKed that one too, and added a script that gives you a pretty simple timelapse facility. What better to point it at than my bread?

Plenty of things, as it turned out, but we're talking proof of principle here. The dough rose proofed fine, as it happened, although it doesn't amount to much in the video because I failed to understand one of the crucial settings in the timelapse script. That's 2.5 kg of dough there, and the total time elapsed is about an hour, shown as three chunks of 10 minutes.


As for the shaped loaves rising, I naturally forgot that the light would be failing while we were out walking the dog and the SD550 was snapping its little heart out. The eye of faith, however, can clearly see the loaves plumping nicely.


The bread turned out just fine. Timelapse, however, needs a little work. But this CGHDK thing could clearly be an enormous time thief given half a chance.
