You can tell it's the silly season: a [history of water](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_PrintFriendly&c=Article&cid=1122155413864&call_pageid=1105528093962&DPL=IvsNDS%2f7ChAX&tacodalogin=yes). (Thanks Luigi.)

Later, that same day, Ruth sends me [this](http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name=ViewWeb&articleId=8112). Now, I don't normally do politics, but for once that old TLA LOL came to pass. It may for you too.
