Michael C. LaBarbera at the University of Chicago has an archive of what must have been interesting lectures on [The Biology of B-Movie Monsters](http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/). Maybe he's the person to illuminate [P.Z. Myers on Buffy's biology](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/and_really_buffys_biology_is_w.php)?
