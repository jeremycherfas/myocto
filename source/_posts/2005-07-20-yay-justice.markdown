Thank heavens England possesses courts that aren't entirely an outreach of government.


> Lord Justice Brooke [said](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4699095.stm): "... All of us have the right to walk the streets without interference from police constables or CSOs unless they possess common law or statutory powers to stop us. If Parliament considered that such a power was needed, it should have said so, and identified the circumstances in which it intended the power to be exercised."

Bless yer, m'lud.
