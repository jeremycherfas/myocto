Spending a very pleasant afternoon building a new look and feel for [the other place](http://agro.biodiver.se/), and getting somewhere, slowly. First off, I managed to place one single post from one specific category in a sidebar. That's good. But then, of course, I wanted to exclude that specific category from the main page. Not so easy. There are ways to do it within The Almighty WordPress Loop, but I tried a couple ond they just weren't working for me and I couldn't see why. Well, someone must have done a plug-in for that sort of thing, so I went looking.

[Kim Woodbridge](http://www.kimwoodbridge.com/2008/08/05/i-am-not-a-wordpress-exclude-categories-stealth-ninja/) seems to have been down the exact same route as me a little while ago, and she found a plug-in, so who am I to argue? [^fn1]
Anyway, I followed the link she thoughtfully gave to a plugin called Ultimate Category Excluder and found myself trapped in an anti-spam hell Which is why I'm not bothering to link to it.

Stuff that for a game of soldiers.

Instead I found a different plug-in called [Advanced Category Excluder](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-category-excluder/) and it is the bee's knees. 'Nuff said.

[^fn1]: By the way, I really like Kim's design; very fine.
