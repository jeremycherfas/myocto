![419968368 C40846Fc92 T](http://jeremycherfas.net/uploads/419968368-c40846fc92-t.jpg) Hot date planned. First I was late out of my meeting. Then the late train was cancelled. I sent an SMS: Very late home, the dog unwalked, phone low on juice. Plugged it in. Dialled her number. and from the next room came that irritating tune. Phoned where she'd been, discovered she'd popped out to look for me, said if she came back I'd be down as soon as I could. Marched on down, dog in tow, and all was just fine. So we had a Campari in the piazza, ate and walked home. Hot date: accomplished.
