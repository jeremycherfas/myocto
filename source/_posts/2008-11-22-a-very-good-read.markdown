I remember reading [Liar's Poker](http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Rising-Through-Wreckage/dp/0140143459%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dadriaantijsse-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0140143459) soon after it came out, and being both amazed and somewhat awed. [Michael Lewis' recent article in Portfolio.com](http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom#) is pitch perfect.
