I still find it odd how, every year, the fact that winter will contain occasional cold spells still creeps up on Italians (and, I believe, Greeks and Spaniards). OK, so it isn't worth installing double glazing -- though it might help keep things cool in summer -- but it might nevertheless be a good idea to have windows that shut properly, central heating that heats, centrally, and so on. Not that I'm complaining, having spent a cosy night beneath an extra blanket. Just observing.
