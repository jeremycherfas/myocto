[Rebecca](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2006/10/visualizing_meaning_project_co.html) has turned up another great find: [Visualizing Meaning](http://martha.mannlib.cornell.edu/charts/) at Cornell University. The entire faculty was asked: "Of the many charts (graph, map, diagram, table and â€˜other') you have seen in your life, which has been the most important, remarkable, meaningful or valuable". The results are wonderful browse-fodder.

Most remarkably of all, the Visualizing Meaning site appears to be powered by WordPress. How'd they do that?
