![19042008.jpg](/uploads/2008/05/19042008.jpg) Having solved my upload problem from WordPress proper, I need to check to see whether I can also upload from ecto. What better way than to share this picture snapped a couple of weeks ago with the phone?

There are some general points to be made. This was a Saturday, a day on which I have never before seen nuns running. And it was late, 9.00 or thereabouts. Again, never before have I seen nuns running at such a late hour. And finally, they were taking a different route from the one on which I have seen them before.

Of course I realize that all of these observations might be entirely wrong, from the point of view of the nuns. Perhaps they always run widdershins later on a Saturday morning. But I feel they should be recorded anyway.

And maybe I need to seek help about this running nun thing.
