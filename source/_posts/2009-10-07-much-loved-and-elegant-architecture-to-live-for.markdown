In modern architecture as in everything, there is good and there is bad. So I wonder what that [monstrous carbuncle](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html) on the face of the much-loved British monarchy would make of this entertaining and very funny Ted Talk by Bjarke Ingels?

  
  
  
  
  
  


The buildings, like the architect, struck me as thoughtful, amusing, ecologically sensitive, highly desirable and entirely likable. Not at all the sort of thing one would expect from "[brogue-footed lickspits in search of, if not knighthoods and peerages, then a biscuit-tin architecture that was somehow meant to recall the glories of Georgian design](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration)". I'd love one to [pockmark my skyline](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/01/design.architecture).
