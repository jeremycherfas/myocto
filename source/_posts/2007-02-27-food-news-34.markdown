Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.8 This week: 88.7**
Tuesday 27 February:** Thursday last I weighed 89.0. The following morning I was 90.6. Between the two I had eaten possibly the saltiest bowl of pasta I can recall. That gave me a new insight into the part water plays in short-term fluctuations. The more interesting observation, of course, is that I didn't send the salt-storm back. Why not? It wasn't really pleasant at all. Not wanting to make a fuss doesn't cut it. I honestly do not know.
