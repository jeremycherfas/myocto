_This post is number 31 in [a series](http://jeremycherfas.net/category/50-x-100-x-50/)._

Prices are sky high. Japanese restaurants are two a penny, whatever that is. Hordes of visibly different people, mostly young, crowd the streets. Voices fill the space with an incessant Babel. Old shops have been replaced, probably more than once. I'm in London on a flying visit, and astounded by diversity and change. The streets, those that aren't being dug up, are littered with cyclists, not just hotshot messengers, and bendy buses.  

Bendy buses are a mayoral election issue. Cyclists don't like them. Nor does anyone else. Those we have in Rome, but that's about all. Not mayoral at all.
