I've noticed that many blogs hosted on Blogspot are unavailable here. Behind the times as I often am, it took a quick Google to discover that they are indeed banned, and not just here, apparently, but also in Pakistan and India. all of them? I suppose that's the only way. There appeared to be a redirect service at [http://www.inblogs.net/](http://www.inblogs.net/) but it doesn't seem to work. [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/), by contrast, does seem to be available. sometimes there may be advantages to being not all that big.

p.s. I am [sooooo proud!](http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&fr=hptb&p=bear+do+shit+in+wooods)
