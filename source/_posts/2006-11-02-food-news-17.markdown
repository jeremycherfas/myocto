Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.?  This week: 87.5
**Thursday 2 November:** Things have been very topsy turvy of late. There is no week 16, because I was away eating delicious foreign muck with no scales and a dead laptop. I'm skipping the number 16 to maintain the count of the number of weeks it has been since starting. In addition to eating too much -- self-imposed portion control when everything is in the middle of the table is more than I can handle -- I'm also not over the water retention of a long flight. But normal service will, I hope, be resumed as soon as possible.
