My friend Rob has unerringly good taste. He has never once given me a totally bum steer, not even Damien Rice. So why did I wait so many months before watching The Edukators (aka [Die Fetten Jahre sind vorbei](http://imdb.com/title/tt0408777/maindetails))? It is bloody marvelous, a wonderful exercise in small-scale ensemble acting that kept me gripped until the very last (very entertaining) scene. There's yoof, idealism, pragmatism, history, double-crosses, crazy love and all sorts. Besides which, any film that makes as much use of Jeff Buckley's version of Hallelujah has to be a good thing.

My rating: 4.5 out of 5
