I mean, I know it is poetry and all, not science, and very cute for all that. But do we really want even poetry readers to think that there are aliens, and that they do leave signatures? Come to think of it, do we want them to think that the "proper" name for the wheat in which non-aliens do not leave signatures is Triticum vulgare (sativum)?

Later ... Mike Kenward's comment prompted me to look at Alec Finlay's web site again, and there is actually a rather fascinating record of a [wheat-based project](http://www.alecfinlay.com/fieldsofwheat.html). I don't know what technology he uses; you'll just have to be patient and watch. I enjoyed it. No aliens, thanks.
