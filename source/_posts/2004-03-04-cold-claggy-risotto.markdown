![Bobo.png](http://jeremycherfas.net/images/Bobo.png) To a sushi party last night, at Bobo's new gaff. (That's him on the left with Fr√§ulein Julia, mugging their favorite movie.) I've always complained that Italian food is perhaps the most conservative I've ever come across. And I've heard the usual explanation: when something is perfect, why tinker? OK. But that doesn't explain why, by and large, with all the usual _caveats_, Italians themselves also seem to be conservative in their food habits.

Bobo, naturally, is an exception. And the homemade sushi were exceptional too. It was good to get a wasabi kick in the back of the nose and then ease the joyful pain with a glass of Monster Killer sake. Two great things I learned last night. One is that there is a Korean grocery near Stazione Termini that stocks all kinds of goodies. The other is that chocolate cake with a white chocolate and wasabi cream icing is really delicious. Not quite as good a combination as chocolate and chilli, but up there, for sure.
